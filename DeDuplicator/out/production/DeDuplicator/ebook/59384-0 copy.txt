                                                  _President-General_.

  THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,
        _Secretary-General_ (77 Main St., Woonsocket, R. I.).

    Dec. 31, 1899.

The business session was well attended, several states being
represented.

Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary-general of the Society, presented the
following annual report:


                    REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.

  The American-Irish Historical Society is on the threshold of its
  fourth year of existence. We are strong in numbers, representative
  in character and devoted to a patriotic work.

  Our growth as an organization has been rapid, but not unstable;
  widespread, but healthy; vigorous, and of permanent value.

  We have solid reason to be proud of what the Society has
  accomplished during the three years it has been in the field. We
  have been accorded a generous welcome from historical societies long
  in existence; our advent has been hailed with satisfaction; our
  motives praised; our publications eagerly sought.

  To-night we meet in New York city for the third time, and for the
  third time we are indebted to our New York members for unbounded
  hospitality, kindliest service and tireless efforts to make our
  annual gathering a success.

  During the year just closed, ninety-two new members have been
  admitted to the Society, and ten of our brothers have died. These
  deaths of the year removed from our ranks the following: Hon.
  Patrick Walsh, Augusta, Ga.; Col. Patrick T. Hanley, Boston, Mass.;
  Hon. John H. Sullivan, Boston, Mass.; Hon. Eli Thayer, Worcester,
  Mass.; Dr. William F. Cummings, Rutland, Vt.; Mr. Joseph J. Kelley,
  Cambridge, Mass.; Mr. William Slattery, Holyoke, Mass.; Rev. George
  W. Pepper, Cleveland, O.; Rev. Denis Scannell, Worcester, Mass.; and
  Mr. Edmund Phelan, Boston, Mass.

  Since our last annual gathering in this city, meetings under the
  auspices of the Society have been held in Providence, R. I.,
  Newport, R. I., and Boston, Mass. In each instance great interest
  was manifested in the mission of the organization, and new members
  were secured.

  Among those in attendance at the Providence meeting was Hon. John D.
  Crimmins, our esteemed general vice-president. On that occasion he
  subscribed $500 to forward the interests of the Society, this being
  the largest individual gift the organization has thus far received.
  Among the speakers at this meeting were the Rev. S. B. Nelson, an
  Irish Presbyterian clergyman, and Rev. Frank L. Phalen, a Unitarian.

  At the Newport meeting, the mayor of the city, Hon. Patrick J.
  Boyle, a member of our Society, presided and delivered an address of
  welcome. Addresses were also made by Hon. Charles E. Gorman of
  Providence; by Rev. Louis J. Deady, a Catholic rector of Newport; by
  City Solicitor Brown of Newport; by Dennis H. Tierney of Waterbury,
  Conn.; by Hon. John C. Linehan of Concord, N. H., and other
  gentlemen.

  At the Boston meeting, President-General Gargan presided, and there
  were addresses by Hon. Patrick A. Collins of Boston and a number of
  others.

  Nor, during the year, has the Society been idle in the field of
  research. Of our members: Mr. Edward Fitzpatrick, Louisville, Ky.,
  has contributed a paper on “The Irish Settlers of Kentucky”; Mr.
  Daniel M. O’Driscoll, Charleston, S. C., has written on “David
  Hamilton, an Irish Soldier of the American Revolution”; Mr. Thomas
  F. O’Malley, Somerville, Mass., has devoted much investigation
  relative to “The Early Transportation of Irish Men, Women and
  Children to the West Indies, to Virginia, and to New England”; Hon.
  John C. Linehan, Concord, N. H., has prepared a paper “On the Irish
  Pioneers of Texas”; Mr. M. E. Hennessy, Boston, Mass., on “Men of
  Irish Birth or Extraction Who Have Attained Distinction in American
  Journalism”; and Mr. Joseph Smith, Lowell, Mass., on “The Irish
  Brigade of Rochambeau’s Army in the American Revolutionary War.” Mr.
  Thomas Carroll, Peabody, Mass., a member of our Society, recently
  delivered an historical address at a church anniversary in that
  place.

  Two of the leading works by our members during the year are those of
  Rev. John J. McCoy of Chicopee, Mass., and Rev. James H. O’Donnell
  of Watertown, Conn. The former has written a history of the Catholic
  diocese of Springfield, Mass., and the latter of the Catholic
  diocese of Hartford, Conn. Both these productions are rich in
  reference to early Irish settlers, that of Rev. Father O’Donnell
  being practically a history of the Irish in Connecticut.

  The annual bound volume of our Society is now in press. It will be
  larger than the book we issued last year, will be illustrated and
  will contain many papers, addresses and other matter of historical
  and literary value.

  At our last annual meeting, the matter of a publication fund was
  discussed and referred to the council of the Society for action. The
  council subsequently decided to issue a circular letter inviting
  contributions to said fund.

  It was decided to send out these circulars immediately after some
  important gathering under the auspices of the Society, when they
  would be likely to attract special interest. The launching of the
  United States torpedo-boat _O’Brien_, at Elizabeth, N. J., was
  finally decided upon as such event.

  Owing to unavoidable delay, however, this launching has not yet
  taken place, and thus a desirable opportunity has not, up to this
  time, presented itself to formulate the circular. I would suggest,
  however, that this meeting possesses the desired prominence as a
  Society event, and that the circular can now be sent out within the
  next week or two.

  During the year, Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet of this city has voluntarily
  subscribed $100 toward the publication fund, and four New York
  gentlemen—Mr. Myles Tierney, Mr. Stephen J. Geoghegan, Mr. James
  McGovern and Mr. John J. Lenehan—have each forwarded a check for $50
  in payment of life membership fee. Mr. William Gorman of
  Philadelphia, Pa., has also become a life member.

  In April next, the historic town of Lexington, Mass., is to have a
  great celebration of the anniversary of the battle of April 19,
  1775, and our Society has been invited to be represented on that
  occasion.

  Some months ago, a Franco-American Historical Society was organized
  at Boston, at which an official of our Society was present and made
  an address of congratulation. The new organization will devote
  itself to the French chapter in American history.

  In conclusion, I desire to say that the correspondence of the
  Society has already become of considerable volume. Inquiries from
  all sections of the country are being constantly received. The
  writers seek information or data of an historical nature relative to
  the Irish and their descendants in the United States. These
  inquiries are promptly answered, and, in return, we receive much
  valuable material.

                          Respectfully submitted,
                                      THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,
                                                  _Secretary-General_.

The foregoing report was accepted and adopted.


                    REPORT OF THE TREASURER-GENERAL.

The treasurer-general of the Society, Hon. John C. Linehan of Concord,
N. H., then presented his annual report. It showed the total income for
the year 1899 to have been $2,228.50. Cash balance on hand Jan. 1, 1899,
$518.60, thus making the total financial resources of the Society for
the year $2,747.10.

The expenditures for 1899, as set forth in detail in the report, were
$2,008.86, leaving a balance on hand of $738.24.

Joseph Smith of Lowell, Mass., for the auditing committee, reported
having examined the books and vouchers of the treasurer-general and
found the same correct.

The treasurer-general’s report was thereupon accepted and adopted.

A communication to the society was announced from Hon. Theodore
Roosevelt, governor of New York, in which he invited the members to be
his guests at the executive mansion in Albany.

The invitation was appreciatively received and acknowledged, and the
president-general was authorized to appoint a delegation to represent
the society by a visit to the governor.

The president-general announced that he would do so, and state the
make-up of the delegation later.

Hon. T. A. E. Weadock of Detroit, Mich., an ex-member of Congress,
presented the names of several applicants for membership in the Society,
and the said applicants were unanimously admitted.

Various other gentlemen also presented many applications for membership,
and the same were all favorably acted upon.

The annual election of officers of the Society then took place, the
result being the same as given on pages 5, 6 and 7 of this volume.

Upon the conclusion of the business meeting, the members and guests
formed in line and proceeded to the banquet hall.


                     ANNUAL BANQUET OF THE SOCIETY.

The company around the tables numbered about one hundred and thirty
gentlemen. President-General Gargan presided. An orchestra was stationed
in the balcony. The decorations were profuse, and were artistically
placed.

Vice-President-General John D. Crimmins, who was at Palm Beach, Fla.,
for his health, sent a telegram regretting his absence, and adding:

“Our Society should flourish. The field is ripe, and so far the surface
is only scratched. When in deeper furrows, forgotten history will be
brought forth that will glorify the deeds of the Irish race in building
our nation.”

Letters of regret at inability to be present were received from Mayor
Van Wyck of New York city, Hon. Patrick A. Collins of Boston, Mass., and
other gentlemen.


                    THE PRESIDENT-GENERAL’S ADDRESS.

President-General Gargan, in rising to open the exercises, spoke
substantially as follows:

  GENTLEMEN OF THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY: In January,
  1897, the first meeting to organize this Society was called at
  Boston. As the reports show, we have now nearly 1,000 members
  residing in almost every state and territory in the United States,
  and representing the best elements in the several walks of life.

  Our object is to see that history is written fairly and impartially.
  During the last twenty-five years we have adopted new methods in
  writing history. The historian who is to write on any epoch no
  longer accepts as truth the recorded facts of another historian who
  has written of a former epoch. He challenges every statement made
  unless corroborated or verified by documentary proof.

  We now have access to many valuable papers and letters that throw a
  new light upon men, their motives and action.

  The history of the United States has been largely written by men of
  English blood, who have unduly glorified the actions of their
  ancestors. More critical and scientific examinations have shown us
  that the Irish element contributed very largely to the settlement of
  the colonies from New England to Georgia, and were an important
  factor in bringing about the Revolution and establishing the
  government of the United States.

  Our Society is now engaged in searching many of the colonial
  records, and I suggest that the members in the different states of
  the Union examine into the origin and ancestry of the prominent men
  in their states, prepare information and write papers that may be
  placed in the archives of this Society.

  I congratulate the members on the increase in numbers, the continued
  prosperity of the Society, and urge all who can to contribute
  liberally to the publication fund, for spoken words are often but
  perishable things, and if the history of the part which our race and
  blood have borne in upbuilding the Republic is to be preserved, we
  can only keep alive the record of their sacrifices, their heroism
  and their patriotism by preserving them in the form of permanent
  memorials, books and publications of the Society.


                     THE ADDRESS OF SENATOR CARTER.

Hon. Thomas H. Carter, U. S. senator from Montana, made an eloquent
address. In the course of his speech he paid deserved compliments to
Hon. P. A. Collins of Boston, Hon. John D. Crimmins and General O’Beirne
of New York, and to other members of the society.

Senator Carter showed the absurdity of calling the United States an
Anglo-Saxon country, and traced the expansion of the original thirteen
states, and the wonderful resources of America. He said in substance:

  A new race has sprung up in this country better than Saxon or Celt.
  The success of the Republic is due to the fact that it unbridles
  manhood. The special purpose of this association is to ascertain
  what part dear old Ireland has played in this drama.

  I am gratified beyond expression that this Society insists on seeing
  justice done to the race from which we have sprung. The work must be
  logical and correct. One of the most remarkable things is the
  intellectuality of the Irish race.

  Wherever freedom’s flag is hoisted you will find an Irishman at or
  near that emblem. O’Higgins in South America is synonymous with
  liberty. On every battlefield in North America the Irishman is
  found, as he also is in poetry, history, arts and sciences. I would
  not adulate the race. The Irishman forms only a part of the American
  citizenship. But whether it is in storming Manila or the capital of
  Great Britain the Irishman will be found doing his work
  enthusiastically.

  I would be delighted to see the Society extended to every state of
  the Union. There are many, very many, incidents in connection with
  the Irish race in America I would like to see set down. As a rule
  the Irish hold the offices, not because they are Irish, but as a
  recognition of ability and the eternal fitness of things.

Senator Carter spoke eloquently in praise of Gen. Thomas Francis
Meagher, one of the original white settlers of Montana, who died while
holding the office of governor of that territory.

Spirited addresses were also made by Hon. Thomas M. Waller, ex-governor
of Connecticut; Judge Wauhope Lynn of New York city; Ex-Congressman
Weadock of Michigan; Hon. William McAdoo of New York; George E. Van
Siclen, who spoke eloquently in behalf of the Boers of South Africa, and
Gen. James R. O’Beirne of New York.

Vocal selections were rendered during the evening, and Miss Sullivan of
New York gave selections on the harp.




            CELEBRATION OF THE LEXINGTON BATTLE ANNIVERSARY.


                   EXERCISES AT LEXINGTON AND BOSTON.

On April 19, 1900, the Society observed the 125th anniversary of the
battle of Lexington, Mass. In connection with the celebration, two
notices were issued to the members, viz.:

                   AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

   (Founded, 1897. First President-General, Rear Admiral R. W. Meade,
                               U. S. N.)

       OBSERVANCE OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON.

  BROTHERS: You are hereby notified that the 125th anniversary of the
  battle of Lexington and “the Concord Fight” will be observed by our
  Society on Thursday, April 19, 1900.

  Our programme for this patriotic occasion will comprise two leading
  features, namely: (1) A visit to Lexington, Mass., in the forenoon,
  and (2) a banquet in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston,
  Mass. Lady friends of the members will be welcome at both events.

  The exercises prepared by the town of Lexington for the day include
  a national salute of 45 guns, morning and evening, a drum corps
  parade at dawn over the historic route of march, and a trades
  procession about midday. Headquarters for the society will be
  established in Lexington at the Russell House, where a reception
  committee will be in attendance.

  The Society will pay its respects to the town officials of
  Lexington, will visit the several points of historic interest and
  will then place a laurel wreath to the memory of the heroes of 1775.
  Members and guests from Boston may take trains from the North Union
  station, that city, at such hour in the morning as may suit their
  convenience, all meeting at the Russell House, Lexington, about
  11:30 a. m. Those desiring, may later take conveyances for Concord.

  The banquet in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston, promises
  to be a brilliant event and should be attended by every member who
  can possibly be present. Preceding the banquet, from 6:30 to 8,
  there will be a reception and concert, and at 8 p. m. the company
  will proceed to the dining hall.

  Tickets for the banquet will be three dollars each, and are now
  ready. Please notify the secretary as soon as possible if you intend
  to be present at the banquet, and whether you will be accompanied by
  guests.

                                  Fraternally,
                                              THOMAS J. GARGAN,
                                                  _President-General_.

  Soon after, we will proceed to the monument on the historic green,
  and there place a memorial wreath, addresses being made by members
  of our Society and invited guests.


                    THE CELEBRATION AT THE BELLEVUE.

  But the most interesting feature of the anniversary will be our
  celebration in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston, Mass. The
  reception and concert will be from 6:30 to 8 p. m., and the banquet
  at 8.

                                      Fraternally,
                                              THOMAS J. GARGAN,

were shown objects of historical interest connected with the battle.
Christopher S. Ryan, the special committee on the part of the town to
receive the members of the Society, did so in a most gratifying manner.

Shortly before noon, the members and guests proceeded to the battle
monument on the “Green” and attached thereto a large wreath, inscribed

                  REMARKS OF PRESIDENT-GENERAL GARGAN.

  _Members and guests of the American-Irish Historical Society_:

  To-day we commemorate the deeds of those heroic men who on April 19,
  1775, on the green at Lexington, won a fame as imperishable as the
  men who fought at Marathon or Thermopylæ. Well might Sam Adams
  exclaim, “What a glorious morning for America is this.” As a
  distinguished foreigner has well said, “It is their sacrificed blood
  in which is written the preface of the nation’s history.”

  At Lexington was the opening scene of a revolution destined to
  change the character of human governments and the condition of the
  human race. Yet I sometimes incline to the opinion, as I read the
  utterances of men who in our day are called statesmen, and some of
  the newspapers, that the age of patriotism has gone; that an age of
  selfish materialists, economists, and calculators has succeeded. Let
  us hope there is still a saving remnant in this republic which will
  rekindle the love and patriotism which actuated the men who
  established our government.

  Do some of the people really understand the meaning of patriotism?
  Many seem to imagine it means blind obedience to any administration
  which may be insidiously laboring to destroy our institutions. But I
  have an abiding faith in the people of this country when they fully
  appreciate a threatened danger. I believe with Burke “that the
  people never give up their liberties but under some delusion.”

  Are some of us laboring under the delusion that we are called upon
  to govern the world, that we are to set forth with a few small
  Bibles and a large supply of arms to force what we call our
  civilization on an unwilling people in another hemisphere, while
  thoughtful men are staggered at the problems of government
  confronting us on the North American continent?

  Shall we not profit by the lessons of history and recall what this
  day means? It was the beginning of a movement against an empire
  which aspired to govern the world. Yet those men on Lexington common
  initiated a revolution which wrested from the diadem of Great
  Britain the fairest jewel in her crown. May we not indulge to-day
  somewhat in retrospection and examine the causes which led to our
  revolt?

  The British parliament had passed the stamp act, the tea tax and the
  Boston port bill, yet those did not cause war; the real cause of the
  battle of Lexington was the reconstruction act of 1774. Prior to
  this act the councilors had been chosen by the people through their
  representatives. By the new law the king was to appoint them, to
  hold office during his pleasure. The superior judges were to hold at
  the will of the king and to be dependent on his will for the amount
  and payment of their salaries; the inferior judges were to be
  removable by the royal governor at his discretion, he himself
  holding at the king’s will.

  The deepest reaching provision of the acts was aimed at the
  town-meetings. They were prohibited, except the annual meeting to
  elect officers, but no other meetings could be held without the
  written permission of the royal governor. These acts of parliament
  sought to change self-government into government by the king, and to
  substitute for home rule, absolute rule at Westminster and St.
  James’s palace.

  Then came the military act, and in February, 1775, parliament
  declared Massachusetts in rebellion. The instructions of Lord
  Dartmouth, the secretary of state for the colonies, to General Gage,
  the royal governor, ran like this: “Sovereignty of the king over the
  colonies requires a full and absolute submission.” What a striking
  similarity that has to some recent dispatches we have heard since we
  acquired distant possessions.

  General Gage’s call for 20,000 men, the assembling of 5,000 troops
  at Boston, and the authority given to General Gage to fire on the
  people, made war inevitable. We see again how history repeats
  itself.

  The people in spite of royal mandates continued to hold their own
  town-meetings, organized county meetings, and made a provincial
  congress. The convention at Middlesex “Resolved, if in support of
  our rights we are called to encounter death we are yet undaunted,
  sensible that he can never die too soon who lays down his life in
  support of the laws and liberties of his country.” Lexington wrote
  to Boston, “We trust in God that should the state of affairs require
  it, we shall be ready to sacrifice our estates and everything dear
  in life, yea, and life itself, in support of the common cause.”

  Nobly did the men of Lexington fulfil that pledge. Shall we in our
  day forget what these men did and dared? Are we so saturated with
  the spirit of commercialism, are we so wedded to the worship of the
  golden calf, that justice and humanity have no place in our modern
  code?

  Let us remember we shall be tried at the bar of history as have been
  other nations; as our opportunities have been greater, so are our
  responsibilities. We cannot escape our liabilities; it is for us to
  so act in the present that this experiment of a free government,
  founded upon manhood suffrage, shall not fail.


                   LETTERS AND PATRIOTIC SENTIMENTS.

  Letters of regret at inability to be present were received from
  ex-Gov. John Lee Carroll of Maryland, president of the Sons of the
  Revolution; Governor Roosevelt of New York, President Eliot of
  Harvard, President Hadley of Yale, Senator Hoar of Massachusetts,
  Senators Hale and Frye of Maine, Senator Mason of Illinois, David
  Starr Jordon, president of Leland Stanford University; E. Benjamin
  Andrews, superintendent of public schools, Chicago; Congressman
  Sulzer of New York, Rector Conaty of the Catholic University,
  President Harper of the University of Chicago, Rev. James H.
  O’Donnell, Watertown, Conn.; Hon. Thomas J. Lynch, Augusta, Me.;
  Hon. James S. Coleman, New York city; Col. John P. Donahoe,
  Wilmington, Del.; Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn.; Col. James
  Quinlan, New York city; John J. Davis, Greenville, Pa.; James
  Connolly, Coronado, Cal.; Col. James Moran, Providence, R. I., and
  from several others.

  Ex-Gov. Carroll of Maryland wrote: “If we contrast the pitiful
  resources of those early days with the present happiness, wealth and
  prosperity of our united country, we can realize the courage of
  those daring men who openly proclaimed that our only purpose was to
  obtain our freedom ‘peaceably if we could, forcibly if we must.’”

  E. Benj. Andrews of Chicago declared: “I assure you that nothing but
  my distance from you prevents my attendance. I should be pleased to
  attend, not only to hear the distinguished gentlemen who will be
  present, but also to testify anew the reverence which all true
  patriots must feel for the brave men who immortalized themselves by
  standing for liberty on Lexington green, 125 years ago.”

  Senator Hoar wrote: “It will not be in my power to attend the
  celebration of the 19th of April in Boston by the American-Irish
  Historical Society. But I am sure that the celebration will be in
  the spirit which animated the men who fought and the men who died on
  the 19th of April, 1775. You will, I am sure, reinforce the lesson
  that no human power can turn wrong into right, injustice into
  justice, or lawfully crush out the love of liberty native in every
  human soul and the right to independence that belongs to every
  people.”

  Gov. Roosevelt said in his letter: “I wish I could be present with
  you at the celebration of the battle of Lexington. It is peculiarly
  appropriate for men of Irish stock to take part in this celebration,
  for they have always done even more than their proper share of
  valiant fighting for the republic.”

  Congressman Sulzer wrote: “I regret exceedingly my inability to
  accept owing to imperative official duties here which demand my
  presence in Washington. If ever there was a time in the history of
  the republic when we should celebrate the battle of Lexington it is
  this year, and I trust your celebration will be a great success in
  every way.”

  From Congressman Capron of Rhode Island: “I am inclined to refer to
  the patriots who fought in the great struggle which initiated the
  war for independence and human liberty with the deepest devotion
  akin to reverence. The event itself should be held in grateful
  remembrance.... Let every American if he would find the spirit which
  animated the men of Lexington look down into his own being and
  analyze the feelings lying there, and if he be a true American he
  will find love of God, love of country, love of home, love of
  liberty, love of law and love of man, all and each of which are the
  essential components of that which we call patriotism. My colleague,
  Mr. Bull, who was also the recipient of your invitation, desires me
  to express his thanks therefor and to say that he heartily joins in
  the sentiments herein expressed.”


                  PRESIDENT HALL OF CLARK UNIVERSITY.

President G. Stanley Hall of Clark University, Worcester, Mass., upon
being introduced, stated that among his ancestors was a Mary Hennessy of
Limerick, Ireland. He then went on to say that:

  The three characteristics of the Irish race, which are most to be
  commended when rightly directed, are, first, their heartiness,
  geniality, enjoyment of life, a nameless quality made of the best
  elements of the German gemuth and the French esprit. This is the
  temperament of genius, it is the conserved youth which makes the
  Irishman an adolescent at whatever age, and is strongly contrasted
  with the sternness and reserve of the Puritan. This temperament,
  too, is connected with the fecundity of the race, also in contrast
  with the Puritan New Englanders, who even in Boston may ere long
  have to hail the Irish race with _morituri salutamus_ with a new
  meaning in it.

  Second, the Irishman, like other men, is not always a man of peace.
  His blood is warmer on occasion and his interpretation of the
  strenuous life, which makes men loved for the enemies they make, is
  another quality which, when rightly trained and directed, is one of
  the greatest powers for good in the world. To be angry aright is
  almost one of the definitions of education.

  Third, the Irishman has a veritable genius for politics, which had
  no scope in the earlier formative days of Irish history, but which
  finds its legitimate sphere in this republican land. He is also a
  patriot, a superb soldier. Politics culminates in statesmanship, and
  I cannot forbear here a word which I believe will appeal to every
  heart which keeps a warm corner for Burke, Emmet or O’Connell.

  My conception of statesmanship is higher than that of politics. The
  first of all conditions of success in its purer realm is utter
  disinterestedness. Within the last few days, this country has
  witnessed the rare spectacle of a senator,[1] unusually devoted to
  the party at whose birth he assisted, and to a president whom he has
  long loved, placing his convictions, matured by long experience and
  ripe knowledge, above both. To no temperament could the personal
  sacrifices have been greater than for him to give us this modern
  version of Aristotle’s “_Plato amicus sed major amicus veritas_.”

  Bound by family lineage, many and long friendships, historical and
  literary associations, with England, his devotion to our national
  muse of liberty which inspired the constitution and the declaration
  of independence impelled him to openly declare sympathy toward the
  struggling patriots in the Transvaal, as in his long life he has had
  occasion to do for Poland, Hungary, Greece, Cuba and Ireland.

  Gentlemen, there is a higher plane than that of the traditions,
  current methods and policies of organizing colonial dependencies. It
  is to believe that every growing race and ethnic stock has higher
  possibilities in it; to hold that the diverse ways of civilization
  are not all exhausted yet, and that instead of forcing other races
  to take up the white man’s, or the Englishman’s burden, our policy
  should be to keep off, where practicable, alien interference,
  including our own, and to develop a new policy of protection and
  thus to foster new and independent centers of social and political
  development.

  To my mind the tragedy of history is the perversion, repression or
  destruction of budding nationalities of species, and perhaps genera,
  different from our own, and the threatened uniformitization of the
  entire world by civilization as we define and understand it. This is
  the method of what, I think, we may call the higher anthropology. It
  would be, I think, the statesmanship of the superman, who may
  sometime exist, and who would be a citizen of all times and a
  spectator of all events. To steer the ship of state in this
  direction is to keep it true to the pole of human destiny. It is the
  work of the heavenborn pilot, who keeps his tiller true, and not of
  the star gazer.

  These moments are big with destiny. Statesmanship is approaching the
  time when it must take a cosmic view of human life as a whole, and I
  have heard no note that rings so clear and pure to my ear with such
  a true flavor of conviction as the plea for a larger ken by the
  political nestor of this state and nation, who has grown not rich
  but poor from a quarter century’s service for his state; who makes
  no bid for the support of other parties, while speaking as many of
  his colleagues in both parties privately declare they would do if
  they spoke for themselves rather than for their constituency; a man
  competent to-day to fill any one of three if not four
  professorships; whose years admonish us that any such utterance may
  be his last, and whom, as in the case of no other public man, his
  political enemies vie with his friends to honor.

President Hall was followed by President Capen of Tufts College who also
delivered an entertaining address.

The historical paper of the evening was by Thomas F. O’Malley, of
Somerville, Mass., whose subject was “Hugh Cargill,” a patriot who took
part in the events of April 19, 1775. The paper displayed close
research.

There were also addresses during the evening by John E. Milholland,
Joseph Smith and E. O’Meagher Condon.

In accordance with the foregoing notice, a number of members of the

  +------------------------------------------------------------------+

Thomas F. O’Malley then addressed the gathering substantially as
follows:

  To-day we meet in pious and patriotic commemoration of a great deed,
  performed here 125 years ago. To-day we stand in the midst of a
  great nation which is proud, strong and free. All is joy around us.
  But let us turn back a century and a quarter in the book of time.
  What a scene was enacted here! The hill crowned with a hastily
  constructed redoubt and held by an undisciplined and untrained
  yeomanry—farmers, with their fowling pieces and but little
  ammunition.

  A brilliantly appointed army advancing to the attack and storming
  the works, supported by coöperating ships and batteries; the blaze
  of the burning town, coursing whole streets or curling up the spires
  of public edifices; the air above filled with clouds of dense black
  smoke, and the surrounding hills, fields, roofs and steeples
  occupied by crowds of spectators. What strange sounds came to the
  ear—the shouts of the contending armies, the crash of falling
  buildings, the roar of ship guns and mortars and the rattle of
  musketry.

  On one side we find the high courage of men staking their lives and
  reputations on the uncertain issue of a civil war; and on the other,
  the reflection that defeat meant the final loss to Britain of her
  American empire.

  You know the story of that battle—how the flower of England’s army
  were repeatedly repulsed; how in the moment of desperation the
  regulars laid aside their knapsacks, moved forward, relying on the
  bayonet and their artillery to carry the day. The American fire
  slackened, the ammunition was expended, there were no bayonets, and
  the oncoming regulars were met with clubbed muskets and stones. The
  fortunes of the day were reversed, and, technically speaking, it was
  a British victory.

After speaking of the men of Irish blood who fought in the patriot ranks
that day, Mr. O’Malley continued:

  The Americans are estimated to have lost in killed 140, and in
  wounded 271; loss by capture 30. In all, 441. The English loss was
  226 killed, 828 wounded. Total—1,054.

  In comparison with other battles, so far as numbers go, Bunker Hill
  was but a skirmish. But in results it was of the utmost importance.
  Before the engagement there was some hope, perhaps some chance, for
  a peaceful settlement of existing difficulties; but after that
  memorable day, all were for war and independence. Bunker Hill was
  the beginning of the end of British domination on the Western
  continent.

Mr. O’Malley was frequently applauded and upon the conclusion of his
address was warmly congratulated. The banquet at the United States Hotel
in the evening was a most enjoyable affair.

President-General Gargan occupied the chair. Among those present were
Hon. John C. Linehan, treasurer-general of the Society, Concord, N. H.;
Secretary-General T. H. Murray, Woonsocket, R. I.; William Doogue, city
forester of Boston; Thomas F. O’Malley, the orator at the memorial
tablets; Joseph Smith, Lowell, Mass.; James Jeffrey Roche, Boston;
William P. Connery, Lynn, Mass.; M. E. Hennessy, Boston; Capt. Samuel
McKeever, U. S. A. (retired), Somerville, Mass.; E. O’Meagher Condon,
New York city; John T. F. MacDonnell, Holyoke, Mass., and others.

President-General Gargan said in his after-dinner address:

  One hundred and twenty-five years have passed since the memorable
  battle of Bunker Hill, commemorated by yonder tall gray shaft at
  Charlestown, familiar to us all from early boyhood. We knew the
  story of that fight before we knew the multiplication table.
  Nominally a British victory, yet a victory purchased at such fearful
  cost to the victors as to inspire the colonists to believe that
  ultimately the triumph would be theirs.

  We all know the story from the American standpoint; few read the
  British accounts of that battle. I was interested to read, a few
  days ago, some of the English accounts; one of them concludes in
  these words:

  “The action has shown the bravery of the king’s troops, who, under
  every disadvantage, gained a complete victory over three times their
  number strongly posted and covered by breastworks, but they fought
  for their king, their law and constitution.”

  That sounds like the account some of the emasculated Americans in
  our day would give of the fight. But Gage wrote to Lord Dartmouth,
  then minister for the colonies:

  “The number of killed and wounded is greater than we could afford to
  lose. The trials we have had show that the rebels are not the
  despicable rabble too many may have supposed them to be.”

  Burgoyne and Clinton, who saw the battle from Copp’s Hill, have also
  written their impressions of the battle in 1775. There were two
  English accounts, historical in their nature. One of these, it is
  thought, was written by Edmund Burke, and was published in the
  Annual Register of that year.

  To all Americans, Bunker Hill was a battle cry and an inspiration
  during the seven long years of war necessary to obtain our
  independence. To-day its memories should rekindle our patriotism and
  prompt us to recall the story of the men who there died that a new
  republic might be born. We know that they believed in God and had
  high ideals.

The historical paper of the evening was by Hon. John C. Linehan and was
of a high order of merit.

Brief addresses were made by Capt. Samuel McKeever, U. S. A., and by
several other gentlemen present, and the company adjourned, well pleased
with the celebration of the day and evening.




                      THE BATTLE OF RHODE ISLAND.


  ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION OF THE EVENT BY THE SOCIETY, AUG. 29, 1900.

A celebration of the anniversary of the battle of Rhode Island took
place at Newport, R. I., Aug. 29, in accordance with the following
notice, sent to each member:

        RHODE ISLAND CHAPTER, AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

     CELEBRATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF RHODE ISLAND.

  DEAR SIR: The Rhode Island members of the American-Irish Historical
  Society will observe the anniversary of the battle of Rhode Island
  on Wednesday, Aug. 29, 1900.

  The celebration will take place at Newport, R. I., and every member
  of our Society throughout the country is cordially invited to be
  present and participate with us in the exercises of the occasion.

  Headquarters for the day and evening will be established at the
  Aquidneck House, where a reception committee will be in attendance.
  Invitations to be present have been extended the governor of Rhode
  Island, the state record commissioner, and the presidents of the
  Rhode Island and Newport Historical societies.

  During the day many points of historical interest will be visited.
  Dinner will be served at 8 p. m. at the Aquidneck. After dinner,
  patriotic addresses and other appropriate features will take place.

  The battle of Rhode Island, as is well-known, was fought Aug. 29,
  1778, the American forces being commanded by Gen. John Sullivan. In
  this battle Sullivan repulsed the British and maintained the field.
  The anniversary is, therefore, one of note and will, we hope, be
  observed by a very large attendance. Please notify the secretary if
  you intend to be present.

                                  Fraternally,
                          PATRICK J. BOYLE (mayor of Newport),
                              _State Vice-President for Rhode Island_.

  THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY
      (Editor _The Evening Call_, Woonsocket, R. I.),
                                  _Secretary_.
    Aug. 1, 1900.

In response to the foregoing, a number of the members from out of the
state visited Newport and were received by the local members of the
Society. Mayor Boyle presided at the banquet in the evening. He made an
address, as did also Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn.; Hon. James F.
Brennan of Peterborough, N. H.; T. F. O’Malley of Somerville, Mass., and
one or two other gentlemen. A patriotic poem was recited by John J.
Rooney of New York city.

Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary-general of the Society, announced that
since the annual meeting the following members of the organization had
died: Hon. Andrew J. White, New York city; Hon. William F. Reddy,

Washington, D. C.; Eugene T. McCarthy, Lynn, Mass.; Dr. William H.
O’Hearn, Lawrence, Mass.; Daniel B. Kelley, Haverhill, Mass.; William H.
Quinn, Hallowell, Me., and Hon. John J. Hayes, Boston, Mass. Appropriate
tributes were paid the memory of the foregoing and minutes adopted
expressive of esteem and regret.

The accession of the following new members was announced: Michael F.
Cox, M. D., M. R. I. A., of the senate of the Royal University of
Ireland; Hon. James D. Phelan, mayor of San Francisco; Francis Q.
O’Neill, president of the Hibernian Bank, Charleston, S. C.; M. le Comte

It was announced that, in addition to the foregoing, the Knights of St.
Patrick, an influential organization of San Francisco, had joined the
Society in a body and had forwarded their life membership fee.
Congratulations were also announced from the Association Artistique et
Litteraire de Saint-Patrice, of Paris, and a communication was received
from the committee of the Pan Celtic Congress.

The announcement was made, and applauded, that Hon. Edward A. Moseley,
recently president-general of the Society, had been elected to
membership in the Society of the Cincinnati, and that Rev. Joshua P.
Bodfish, of our organization, had been chosen a director of the Bunker
Hill Monument Association.

A communication was read from T. M. Bryan of Montesano, Wash., giving a
sketch of his great-grandfather, John Bryan, an Irishman who came to
this country and served in the patriot ranks during the War of the
Revolution. He is mentioned in the Pennsylvania archives and is believed
to have been at Valley Forge during the terrible winter of 1777‒8.

A letter was also received from Rev. Fred B. Cole, chancellor of the
Protestant Episcopal diocese of Rhode Island, in which he very kindly
offered his services as guide in a contemplated pilgrimage of the
Society to the grave of “Old Parson” MacSparran. Rev. Dr. MacSparran was
an Irishman born toward the close of the seventeenth century, and who
for nearly forty years, was pastor of St. Paul’s church in Narragansett,
R. I. A vote of thanks was tendered Rev. Mr. Cole.

Congratulations were extended the Rev. Austin Dowling, a member of the
Society, on the completion of his history of the Roman Catholic diocese
of Providence, R. I., the same containing much valuable material in the
Society’s line of work.

During the evening, letters regretting their inability to be present
were announced from Governor Gregory of Rhode Island, President Faunce
of Brown University, R. H. Tilley, state record commissioner of Rhode
Island; Hon. John C. Linehan, Concord, N. H.; Joseph Smith, Lowell,
Mass.; Col. D. S. Lamson, Weston, Mass.; James L. O’Neill, Elizabeth, N.
J.; Rev. Owen Kiernan, Fall River, Mass., and from other gentlemen.

The following letter, which had just been received by Secretary T. H.
Murray, aroused special interest when read to the assembled company:

[Illustration: DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION]

  MY DEAR MR. MURRAY:

  Mr. R. H. Tilley has advised me to write you, as a valuable man to
  interest in a project which should be of interest to every loyal
  Rhode Islander.

  The old historic fort on Butts Hill in Portsmouth is being surveyed
  with the idea of selling in small lots, and thus totally
  obliterating the fort where General Sullivan and his troops fought
  so well and so bravely. Does it not seem as if this spot should be
  preserved if possible? I believe a bill was introduced into the
  legislature some time ago, making this fort a state park, but
  nothing has since been heard of it, so far as I can find out.

  Miss Swinburne, regent of William Ellery Chapter, D. A. R., and I
  are very desirous of rousing among the patriotic societies a
  sufficient interest to save this well-preserved relic of
  Revolutionary days. It seems a peculiarly fitting season to begin
  the agitation, and I hope that some of the speakers on Wednesday,
  both at the celebration by your own Historical Society and also at
  the meeting of the Sons of the Revolution on the same day, may feel
  inclined to call attention to this subject.

  I talked with Mr. Tilley[2] yesterday and found him as kindly
  disposed to help as I could desire, and he has promised to add his
  word in support of my request whenever he may chance to see you. I
  can answer for my own Gaspee Chapter, D. A. R., if our assistance is
  needed, but with such influence as you could wield, coöperating with
  the S. A. R and S. R. of the state, I feel very hopeful of success
  in our patriotic project.

  I do not feel as if I had at all adequately presented my case, but
  it is very hard to condense all that might be said on such a subject
  into the limits of a reasonable note. I hope you will recognize my
  endeavor to save your valuable time, and read into my words an
  enthusiastic interest which I have not expressed.

                          Very sincerely yours,
                                  MARGARET B. F. LIPPITT,[3]
                                    _Regent, Gaspee Chapter, D. A. R._

  NEWPORT, R. I., August twenty-sixth.

The following letter on the same topic as the foregoing was received by
Mayor Boyle of Newport, state vice-president of our Society for Rhode
Island:

[Illustration: DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION]

  DEAR SIR:

  At the meeting of the Irish patriotic society to be held on August
  twenty-ninth, to celebrate the battle of Rhode Island, would it be
  possible to bring up the subject of the old fortifications on Butts
  Hill and call attention to the danger which threatens them, namely,
  their destruction?

  Few such spots remain on this island, and is it not the duty as well
  as privilege of all loyal patriots to help preserve such spots where
  our forefathers so hardly fought and whose names we honor and
  revere?

  I hope this may receive your support and that you will consider it
  of sufficient importance to bring before your society.

                    Yours very truly,
                                      SUSAN P. SWINBURNE,
                            _Regent, William Ellery Chapter, D. A. R._

  August twenty-eight,
                 245 Broadway, Newport, R. I.

Butts Hill, to which Mrs. Lippitt and Miss Swinburne refer, is in
Portsmouth, R. I. The fortifications alluded to were constructed by Gen.
John Sullivan in 1778, in connection with the siege of Newport and the
subsequent battle on Rhode Island.

The meeting expressed itself as heartily in favor of the project
mentioned in the two letters and referred the subject-matter to the
executive council of the Society.

On the same evening that this celebration of the battle anniversary was
being held by our members at the Aquidneck, another celebration of the
anniversary was taking place at the Newport Casino, under the auspices
of the Newport Sons of the Revolution.

During the evening, greetings were sent by the Sons assembled at the
Casino to our members at the Aquidneck. Messrs. Sanborn and Garrettson
of Newport, and Lieutenant Commander Murdock, U. S. N., were delegated
to proceed to the Aquidneck and present our members a handsome floral
tribute. The presentation speech was made by Mr. Garrettson, and the
tribute was accepted, on behalf of our Society, by Mayor Boyle. Later,
several of our members accepted an invitation from the Sons to be their
guests, and proceeded to the Casino, where they were warmly greeted and
hospitably entertained.

John P. Sanborn of the Sons, who was then presiding, paid a glowing
tribute to Gen. John Sullivan and to the Irish element, generally, in
American history. While at the Casino, several of our members were
called on for remarks and responded. Thus Mayor Boyle made a brief
address, as did Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn. John J. Rooney of New
York recited a patriotic poem, and Hon. James F. Brennan of
Peterborough, N. H., spoke eloquently of the services of General
Sullivan.




                          PAPERS OF THE YEAR.

     READ BY MEMBERS AT MEETINGS OF THE SOCIETY, OR CONTRIBUTED FOR
                      PUBLICATION IN THIS VOLUME.




  REV. JAMES MAC SPARRAN, IRISHMAN, SCHOLAR, PREACHER AND PHILOSOPHER,
                               1680‒1757.

                     BY THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY.[4]


Rev. James MacSparran was one of the great men given by Ireland to Rhode
Island in the early half of the eighteenth century. For nearly forty
years he was rector of St. Paul’s church,[5] in Narragansett, R. I., and
forms one of the grand figures in Rhode Island history.

He was born in or near Dungiven, Londonderry, Ireland, about the year
1680. He received the degree of M. A. from Glasgow University in 1709,
and that of D. D., from Oxford in 1731. He belonged to a Presbyterian
family. His first visit within the present territory of Rhode Island was
made about 1718.

He came from Boston to Bristol, then a part of Massachusetts, and
stopped during his visit at the house of a relative, the Widow
Pompelion, who resided at the corner of Hope and State streets.
Possessing credentials as a licentiate, he preached in Bristol and was
favorably received. Munro thus narrates[6] the incident:

“The pulpit was vacant, and the young Irishman was invited to preach in
the meeting house on the Sunday after he reached Bristol. Mr. M^cSparran
possessed, in an unusual degree, the remarkable eloquence with which so
many of the children of Ireland have been endowed, and his wonderful
oratory made such a deep impression upon the minds of his hearers that
at a church meeting held on the 16th of December, 1718, he was invited
to settle in the town as its pastor. On the 22d of December the town
concurred in the church’s choice, 73 votes being cast for Mr. M^cSparran
and but three against him.”

It was voted that his salary be £100 per year, and £100 was appropriated
toward the expense of his settlement. Thus far matters had gone along
smoothly. Trouble now arose, however. A date had been fixed for his
ordination, but the ministers who were expected to officiate refused to
do so.

MacSparran[7] being desirous of a settlement, offered to submit to lay
ordination. In the meantime, Rev. Dr. Mather of Massachusetts had
instituted charges against him. One of these was “Unguarded
conversation.” The matter came before a town-meeting in May, 1719, and
MacSparran was exonerated. Angered by their defeat, his opponents then
questioned the genuineness of his credentials. In order to give him an
opportunity to establish his standing, the town:

“Voted, That leave be granted to Mr. James MacSparran, our present
minister, to take a voyage to Ireland, in order to procure a
confirmation of his credentials, the truth of which being by some
questioned; and that he return to us again some time in June next
ensuing and proceed in the work of the ministry with us, if he procure
the confirmation of the aforesaid credentials.”

MacSparran departed, but never returned to that church or denomination.
The harsh and illiberal treatment he had received from Mather and other
zealots displeased him, and soon after he entered the Church of England,
in which he remained until his death.

MacSparran came to these parts again in 1721, this time as a Church of
England missionary. He began his ministerial labors at St. Paul’s church
in Narragansett (Kingstown, R. I.), and had charge of that colonial
parish until his death in 1757. The settlers in that neighborhood had
been visited by two ministers previous to Dr. MacSparran’s coming, but,
as he declares, “they lacked resolution to grapple with the difficulties
of the mission above a year apiece.”

MacSparran married Miss Hannah Gardiner, daughter of William Gardiner,
on May 22, 1722. The ceremony was performed in St. Paul’s church,
Narragansett, by Rev. Samuel Honeyman, who had gone from Newport for the
purpose. Dr. MacSparran was proud to be known as an Irishman. He could
write and speak the Irish language, and always had a great affection for
his native land. He was a kindly, noble-hearted man, and could, when
occasion required, eloquently defend his Roman Catholic
fellow-countrymen.

His very interesting work, “America Dissected,” was published at Dublin
in 1753. It gives us a good idea of the extent of Irish immigration and
of other matters in the colonies at that time. The work comprises
letters addressed by Dr. MacSparran from Narragansett “in the colony of
Rhode Island” to friends in Ireland. Here are extracts from one written
by him to Col. Henry Cary, under date of August, 1752:

“There has lately been made, upon and behind the mountains of Virginia,
a new Irish settlement, by a transmigration of sundry of those that,
within these thirty years past, went from the north of Ireland to
Pennsylvania. As the soil in that new Irish settlement is natural and
friendly to grass, they will for many years to come raise great
quantities of neat cattle.”

Writing of Maryland he says: “As the late Lord Baltimore was the first
Protestant peer of the Calvert family, his predecessors (as it was
natural they should) first peopled this province with a colony of Irish
Catholics.... There are some Quakers here, in consequence of its
bordering on Pennsylvania, and some Irish Presbyterians, owing to the
swarms that, for many years past, have winged their way westward out of
the great Hibernian hive.”

Again referring to Pennsylvania, Dr. MacSparran writes: “The Irish are
numerous in this province, who, besides their interspersions among the
English and others, have peopled a whole county by themselves, called
the county of _Donnegal_, with many other new out-towns and districts.
In one of these frontiers, on the forks of Delaware, I assisted my
brother (who left Ireland against my advice) in purchasing a large tract
of land, which by his wife’s demise, above a year ago, descends to his
children. The exportations from this province are principally wheaten
flour, which they send abroad in great quantities; and by the accessions
and industry of the Irish and Germans, they threaten, in a few years, to
lessen the American demands for Irish and other European linens.”

Alluding to New Hampshire he continues: “In this province lies that town
called London-Derry, all Irish, and famed for industry and riches.”

Then, leaving New Hampshire, he continues: “Next you enter Main,[8]
which in its civilized government, is annexed to the Massachusetts, as
Sagadahock also is; and both rather by use than right. In these two
eastern provinces many Irish are settled, and many have been ruined by
the French Indians and drove from their homes. It is pretty true to
observe of the Irish,[9] that those who come here with any wealth, are
the worse for their removal; though, doubtless, the next generation will
not suffer so much as their fathers; but those who, when they came, had
nothing to lose, have throve greatly by their labour.”

Dr. MacSparran’s reference to Rhode Island is of particular interest. He
writes of it as follows: “... the little colony of Rhode Island, etc.,
where Providence has fixed me, and where I have resided in quality of
missionary thirty-one years last April.... This little district extends
itself no more than forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth, or it
may be forty [for I write to you, sir, from memory]. It contains
1,024,000 acres, and is peopled with about 30,000 inhabitants, young and
old, white and black.... In 1700, after Quakerism and other heresies
had, in their turn, ruled and tinged all the inhabitants for the space
of forty-six years, the Church of England, that had been lost here
through the neglect of the crown, entered, as it were, unobserved and
unseen, and yet not without some success.

“A little church was built in Newport, the metropolis of the colony, in
1702, and that in which I officiate in Narragansett, in 1707.... I
entered on this mission in 1721, and found the people not a ... clean
sheet of paper, upon which I might make any impressions I pleased; but a
field full of briars and thorns, and noxious weeds, that were all to be
eradicated, before I could implant in them the simplicity of truth. By
my excursions and out labours, a church is built 25 miles to the
westward of me, but not now under my care; another 16 miles to the
northward of me, where I officiate once a month; and at a place six
miles further off, on the Saturday before that monthly Sunday. I
gathered a congregation at a place called New Bristol, where now
officiates a missionary from the Society, and I was the first Episcopal
minister that ever preached at Providence, where, for a long time, I
used to go four times a year, but that church has now a fixed missionary
of its own.”

In another place he tells us: “There are above three hundred vessels,
such as sloops, schooners, brigantines, and ships, from sixty tons and
upwards, that belong to this colony, and they are carriers for other
colonies.”

The church of St. Paul was built in 1707. When Kingstown was divided, in
1722, into the towns of North and South Kingstown, the church became
located about a mile over the line in the former place. In 1791 it was
incorporated as St. Paul’s church in North Kingstown. In 1800 the
building was removed to Wickford and the parish divided.

Dr. MacSparran was for nearly four decades closely identified with the
highest social and intellectual life of the colony. His scholarly
attainments made him the centre of a group[10] of cultivated minds. As
pastor of St. Paul’s church, he ministered to many of the leading
families in Rhode Island. He officiated at their weddings, administered
baptism, preached the gospel according to his convictions, and when
loved ones died uttered sweet words of condolence, sympathy and hope.

The church records contain such leading names as Updike, Arnold,
Lippitt, Gardiner, Helme, Wilkinson, Potter, Robinson and a large number
of others.

But “Parson” MacSparran, as he was lovingly called, was not alone the
friend and associate of the well-to-do. His love for the poor and lowly
was unbounded, and this sympathy found ample reciprocation in the hearts
of the humble.

In order to understand the general character of Narragansett society at
that period a few words may be necessary. Amos Perry[11] says: “The
honor of being, par excellence, the Narragansett country is generally
conceded to Charlestown and the original ‘Kings Towne,’ whose united
area is 19.8 per cent. of that of the entire state.” To make it plainer,
it should be said that the “Narragansett country” comprised that portion
of the state of Rhode Island now known as Washington county. It was so
called because it was the seat of the Narragansett Indians.[12] In 1654
it was named King’s Province, which in 1729 was changed to King’s
county. In 1781 that monarchical designation was dropped and the name
Washington substituted.

The county now comprises the towns of Charlestown, Exeter, Hopkinton,
North Kingstown, South Kingstown, Richmond, and Westerly. The
“Narragansett country” had long existed as an independent jurisdiction.
Finally, the king in council promulgated his decision uniting the
“King’s Province or Narragansett” to Rhode Island. For long years after,
the name “Narragansett country” was still affectionately retained in the
nomenclature of that district. In Dr. MacSparran’s time there were
numbers of wealthy landholders in Narragansett. Many of these owned
thousands of acres each and had great herds of cattle and flocks of
sheep. Many, too, were slave owners and slave dealers. As late as 1804,
Rhode Island had fifty-nine vessels engaged in the slave trade,
notwithstanding an act was passed in 1787 forbidding the traffic.[13]

For a long period the slaves were practically barred out of the church.
They were neither instructed, baptized, nor admitted to the communion.
To bestow such favors upon them was considered inconsistent by their
masters. But MacSparran, the great-hearted Irishman, combated this
error. He emphatically protested against this unchristian exclusion of
the slaves and ultimately prevailed in their behalf.

The Narragansett landholders and their families lived in princely style
on their vast estates. They were a hospitable race, cordial in their
welcomes, warm and lasting in their attachments. Fond of horse racing,
they raised a breed known as “Narragansett Pacers,” which became famous
throughout the country. Fox-hunting was also a favorite sport.

The glebe house occupied by Dr. MacSparran for over thirty years is yet
standing. It overlooks the Pettaquamscutt river. This river is really a
connected series of pretty lakes. Mr. Hazard once termed them the
“Killarneys of New England.” Dr. MacSparran taught many pupils at his
home, imparting a knowledge of the Greek and Latin classics and various
other branches. Writing in 1752, he says: “Mr. Thomas Clap, president of
Yale college, was my scholar when I came first to these parts, and on
all occasions gratefully acknowledges his receiving the first rudiments
of his learning from me, who, by the way, have not but a modicum to
boast of myself.” Dr. MacSparran has left this significant entry: “In
Bristol, New England, February 5th, 1722, were imprisoned in jail twelve
men of the Church of England for refusing to pay for the support of the
Presbyterian teacher, viz.: Mr. Nathaniel Cotton.” Others were
imprisoned in 1724 for a like offense, and Dr. MacSparran says: “I have
inserted this line in the church records, that the age to come may not
forget the opposing spirit of New England Presbyterians.” The following
extracts from the records of St. Paul’s church may prove of interest:

“July 11, 1721, four children were baptized at Providence, viz.: Mary
Bernon, and Eva Bernon, Anna Donnison, and Elizabeth Donnison, by Rev.
Mr. McSparran.

“November 8th, 1724. Captain Benoni Sweet was baptized at St. Paul’s, in
Narragansett, by the Rev. Mr. McSparran.

“April 22d, 1730. In Westerly, Narragansett, Christopher Champlin and
Hannah Hill, daughter of Captain John Hill, were joined together in holy
matrimony by the Rev. Mr. McSparran, at the house of the said Captain
John Hill.

“May 2d, 1730. Daniel Updike, Attorney-General of the Colony and
Lieutenant-Colonel of the militia of the Islands, was baptized by
immersion (in Petaquamscut river) by the Rev. Mr. McSparran, in presence
of Mr. McSparran, Hannah McSparran, his wife, and Josiah Arnold, church
warden, as witnesses.

“December 11th, 1735. Dr. Giles Goddard[14] of Groton, in Connecticut,
was married to Miss Sarah Updike, at the house of her father, Captain
Lodowick Updike, by Mr. McSparran.

“August 6, 1747. Dr. McSparran baptized Mrs. Elizabeth Wilkinson, wife
of Capt. Philip Wilkinson,[15] by immersion in Petaquamscut pond.
Witnesses, the Doctor, his wife, and Mrs. Coddington.

“Sept. 6th, Thursday, 1750. The bans of marriage being duly published at
the church of St. Paul’s, in Narragansett, no objections being made,
John Anthony, an Indian man, was married to Sarah George, an Indian
woman, the widow and Dowager Queen of Geo. Augustus Ninegret, deceased,
by Dr. McSparran.

“Nov. 18, 1750. Sunday, the banns being first duly asked, at St. Paul’s,
Dr. McSparran married William Potter, youngest son of Col. John Potter,
to Penelope Hazard, eldest daughter of Col. Thomas Hazard, both of South
Kingstown, at Col. Thomas Hazard’s house.

“Nov. 7, 1752. Dr. McSparran, at the house of Colonel Thomas Hazard, on
Boston Neck,[16] married George Hazard (son of George, the son of old
Thomas Hazard) to Sarah Hazard, the third daughter of said Colonel
Hazard.

“April 11th, 1756, being Palm Sunday, Doctor McSparran read prayers,
preached, and baptized a child named Gilbert Stewart,[17] son of Gilbert
Stewart, the snuff-grinder. Sureties, the Doctor, Mr. Benjamin Mumford,
and Mrs. Hannah Mumford.”

In 1741‒2, MacSparran in a letter to the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Foreign Parts, writes that in the middle arm of the sea,
which divides the island of Rhode Island from the Narragansett shore,
lies an island called Conanicut, “about eight or nine miles long, and
two wide, containing about four or five hundred inhabitants, who had
never had Christianity preached to them in any shape than Quakerism,”
until he addressed them upon express invitation. He was so pleased with
his first visit to the island that he determined to repeat the visit
monthly. In the course of his letters he expresses the wish that Ireland
was at liberty to send the colonies her woolens instead of her linens,
“which will soon cease to be in demand here.”

MacSparran was unalterably opposed, in season and out of season, to all
efforts to form a legislative union between England and Ireland. He
gives expression to his sentiments on this point, in a letter to
Ireland,[18] wherein he declares:

“Our attention has for some time been taken up with the news of measures
on foot to unite Ireland to England, as Scotland is. I pray God they may
never take effect; for if they do, farewell liberty. You are greater
slaves already than our negroes, and an union of that kind would make
you more underlings than you are now. The accounts of the open
irreligion of the greater island inclines me to imagine, that Ireland is
on the brink of obtaining (as if these accounts are true, it deserves),
its ancient name of Insula Sanctorum. But if ever you come into a closer
connection with the more eastern island, corruption will increase.... I
suppose those that are sent to rule with you, like those who sometimes
are sent here, imagine fleecing to be a better business than feeding the
flock. The revolution which happened before you and I were born, might
be thought a wise and necessary measure, but we see it has been followed
with some bad consequences. To get free from Popery, we have run into
infidelity and scepticism.... Except the little revival religion had in
Queen Ann’s reign, the church has gained no ground, but in America,
since that period.”

Dr. MacSparran, in a letter addressed[19] to a friend in Ireland under
date of 1752, again refers to Rhode Island, saying: “There are here,
which is no good symptom, a vast many law suits, more in one year than
the county of Derry has in twenty ... and Billy McEvers has been so long
your father’s and your honor’s constable, that he would make a very good
figure on the bench of our courts of sessions and of common pleas, and
no contemptible one on those of our courts of assize and general gaol
delivery.”

Writing to his friend William Stevenson, in Ireland, Aug. 21, 1752,
MacSparran informs him that “My brother and his wife died a year ago
last June.... I have to go for England for ten or twelve months, to go
to the baths for better health; if I can bring matters to bear to get to
England, my next push will be to be seated in Ireland.... I am in the
hands of a good God, who has the hearts of men at command; and if he
sees that I can serve the interests of Christ’s church, either in the
use of the English or Irish language, which you know I can write and
read, and upon occasion could preach in, He will raise me up friends,
and restore me to my native land, or near it—if not, His will be done.”

Dr. MacSparran’s brother, whom he mentions, Archibald, sailed from
Ireland for Rhode Island, but the ship made another port and he settled
near New Castle on Delaware bay. He had seven children: Margaret, Eliza,
Bridget, John, James, Archibald, and Joseph. Dr. MacSparran, as I have
said, had no children. The Doctor and his wife went to England sometime
before 1755. She died there in the latter year.

The Doctor returned to Rhode Island and made pastoral visits to
Providence, Warwick and several other places. In 1757 he died.[20] The
manner of his death was a little remarkable. It is thus described in
papers in the possession of the Updike family:

“Dr. MacSparran caught his death at father’s. He went to prayer, and had
read and was going to kneel, and being a fat, heavy man, and putting his
hands on the table to ease himself down, the table split off and his
weight came down and he hit the edge of his eyebrow against the sharp
edge of the table leg and he bled profusely—but he would have nothing
done till he had finished his prayer. They bound it up and he got home
and never recovered.”

He was buried under the communion table of St. Paul’s. In 1781 his
successor, Rev. Samuel Fayerweather, was laid beside him. It is believed
that Dr. MacSparran had written a history of Narragansett, but the
manuscript was not found after his death. It may have previously been
sent to Ireland. He bequeathed his house and farm to church purposes and
the property became a glebe for the rectors of St. Paul’s.

Sometime previous to his death he sent his diplomas as Master and Doctor
to Rev. Paul Limrick, a cousin in Ireland, requesting the latter to have
them registered in the parish registry of Dungiven. He asked to have
this done “not through vanity, but being a pilgrim on earth and not
knowing but my _carcase_ may fall in a strange land, it would be
pleasing to me that my relations in time to come might be able to speak
of me with authority.”




MEN OF IRISH BLOOD WHO HAVE ATTAINED DISTINCTION IN AMERICAN JOURNALISM.

                    BY MICHAEL EDMUND HENNESSY.[21]


In journalism, as in every other walk of life, men of Irish blood are,
and have been, leaders of those who mould public opinion. As American
newspaper men, Irish-Americans have added new laurels to the fair name
of Erin’s sons. Irish in name, their intense Americanism pervades every
cosmopolitan journal from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the
Canadian line to the Gulf of Mexico.

Irishmen were among the pioneers in the establishment of the early
American newspapers. It would, indeed, be interesting to follow one by
one, step by step, the career of the men of Irish blood who, more than a
hundred years ago, braved blind prejudice and established newspapers
which did so much for American freedom, and later labored so hard for
internal improvements, the developing and the upbuilding of the great
Republic.

Irishmen were among the first paper manufacturers in this country. Many
of them, prior to the Revolutionary War, were engaged in the printing
business. Naturally they drifted into publishing newspapers. At the
period immediately following the Revolution, it is estimated by the
census bureau that there were published in the United States two hundred
papers. Of these, it is said, twenty-five were controlled by foreigners,
and were, as a rule, the most influential papers published, and were
issued in the large towns like Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

The election of John Adams as president, and the inauguration of his
federal policy, brought into being a strong opposition press, which
arrayed itself on the side of Thomas Jefferson. The editors of that
period, not unlike the politicians of their time, did not mince matters.
Their trenchant quills smote the Federalists with such force that the
administration of Mr. Adams deemed it necessary to pass a law that would
curb the spirit of the times and muzzle the opposition press. The result
was the enactment of the Alien and Sedition act. The twenty-five papers
which were controlled by the foreigners were the special mark of the
alien and sedition laws.

Appleton’s Encyclopedia, speaking on this subject, says:

“The apology for the sedition act was the unquestionable licentiousness
of the press, which, at that time, was chiefly controlled by refugees
and adventurists from Great Britain and Ireland.”

Lossing, in his United States History, says, “that outside of New
England, the most influential papers were controlled principally by
foreigners.”

The majority of the refugees and adventurists, so called, were men of
Irish blood; all of them men of learning, enterprise and push. They
hated the Federalists for their pro-English leanings, especially
President Adams, whom they believed to be friendly to England in the
contest against France. Several of them had had a taste of British
tyranny at home, and all were imbued with the spirit of ’98.

Among the very earliest newspaper enterprises was that of Hugh Gaine in
New York city. Gaine was a native of Ireland. He began his new world
career as a book-seller. In 1752 he commenced the publication of the
_Mercury_. Hudson, in his history of journalism in the United States,
says of the paper, that it was one of the best in all the colonies in
the collection of intelligence. Hugh Gaine prospered as an editor,
book-seller and publisher.

How noble was the attitude of Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, who lent
his mighty influence to launching the _Maryland Gazette_. His financial
and moral aid made possible its vigorous contest for the freedom of the
colonies.

The alien and sedition act was particularly aimed at the Irishmen, who,
almost to a man, arrayed themselves under the broad banner of Jefferson,
the leader of the Republicans. The first man to suffer under the alien
and sedition laws was an Irishman, Congressman Matthew Lyon of Vermont,
a native of Wicklow, a printer, who started the _Farmer’s Library_, and
later issued the _Fairhaven Gazette_. This “peppery, red-headed little
Irishman,” as he was called by his contemporaries, hated everything that
had the odor of Federalism about it, and for an article written by him,
published in a Vermont paper, reflecting on President John Adams, he was
indicted by the United States Court. A writer, speaking of the article
for which he was indicted, says that “the language was decidedly
Lyonesque.” He was fined $1,000 and imprisoned for three months. While
in jail he was reëlected to congress, and on his release would have been
rearrested on another charge under the same act, had he not availed
himself of his constitutional rights and declared that he was on his way
to Philadelphia to attend a sitting of Congress.

Lyon is remembered for his varied congressional life, and the episode
especially with Congressman Griswold of Connecticut. Griswold referred
to Lyon deprecatingly one day, and revived an old story of alleged
cowardice during the Revolutionary War, which his political opponents
used against him. The result was an exhibition of old-time pugilism on
the floor of congress. For this offence an attempt was made to expel him
from the house on two occasions, but each time it failed for want of a
two-thirds vote.

Lyon had the distinguished honor of having been elected as a
representative from three states to congress,—Vermont, Kentucky and
Arkansas. He learned the trade of a printer when a boy, ran away from
the old country and settled in Vermont. Governor Chittenden took a great
interest in the young Irish lad, and helped him in many ways. He married
a daughter of the governor’s, and engaged in the manufacture of iron and
paper. Becoming involved financially, in trying to build a flotilla of
gunboats on the Delaware for the infant American navy, he moved to
Kentucky, and there set up another printing office, the first in the
state. He was elected to Congress in 1804, serving until 1810.

He was the first delegate to Congress from Arkansas, having taken up his
residence in Little Rock, but he died before taking his seat. To Matthew
Lyon also belongs the distinguished honor of having cast the vote of
Vermont for Jefferson for president against Adams in that critical
period of American history, when the choice of president was thrown into
the house of representatives.

His son, Chittenden, was a prominent man of his day, a member of
congress, and took an active part in public affairs. In 1840 congress
refunded Matthew Lyon’s son the $1,000 fine imposed upon his father
under the alien and sedition act.

In Massachusetts, Attorney-General James Sullivan, afterward congressman
and governor, the son of Irish emigrants, wrote and published a most
able paper entitled, “A Dissertation on the Constitutional Freedom of
the Press,” severely arraigning the sedition law. After enumerating the
power of congress, Mr. Sullivan said:

“It is very clear that, considering a libel as a private injury, the
congress can have no authority to enact a law for its definition or
punishment.... It went beyond what the constitution would warrant.” In
his final summing up, Attorney-General Sullivan said, “that a
reasonable, constitutional restraint, judicially exercised, is the only
way in which the freedom of the press can be preserved as an invaluable
privilege to the nation.”

The alien and sedition laws were soon effaced from the statute books
when the Democratic party came into power under Jefferson. Inasmuch as
these laws were aimed especially at the men of Irish blood, who sought
freedom at home in vain and came here to enjoy it, it was especially
fitting that an Irishman, Senator Smilie of South Carolina, should
introduce the bill for their repeal. He was chairman of the committee on
foreign affairs on the part of the senate.

John T. Morse, in his “American Statesmen” series, characterizes the
alien and sedition laws as the “two great blunders of the Federal
party,” and adds: “No one has ever been able heartily or successfully to
defend these foolish outbursts of ill-considered legislation.”

Another Irishman, John Daly Burk of _The Time-Piece_ published in New
York city was arrested under the alien and sedition law. This John Daly
Burk had a most interesting history. He published the first daily paper
in Boston. Said to be of the same family as the great Edmund Burke, he
was expelled from Trinity College, Dublin, for patriotic articles
contributed to the _Dublin Evening Post_, a paper which advocated the
cause of the people against the rule of England. The expulsion of young
Burk from Trinity only rekindled his patriotism and he rallied around
the young band of patriots who were getting ready for the uprising of
’98. A brother patriot was being led to the gallows one day. As the
procession passed Trinity’s steps, where Burk, in company with about
thirty young men, was standing, he called out that if there was an
Irishman in the crowd, to follow him for the purpose of rescuing the
prisoner. The attempt proved unsuccessful. Burk escaped to a house where
lived a woman named Daly. She fitted him out in woman’s garb and in this
disguise he escaped from Ireland, making his way to America, landing in
Boston. Being without means and desiring to show his gratitude to his
protectress, Burk assumed her name, and ever after he signed himself
John Daly Burk.

Boston in those days was not a very hospitable town for an Irishman to
settle in, but Burk fought against great odds and overcame what seemed
to be insurmountable obstacles. On October 6, 1796, he issued the _Polar
Star and Daily Advertiser_. It was the first daily paper published in
the town. It was printed by Alexander Martin, at the corner of Water
Street and Quaker Lane. Copies of the paper are extant, and are well
worth perusal. It had considerable display advertising. It started out
with a well written address to the public on the advantages of a daily
paper. Speaking of the policy of the paper, the editor said: “It will
have more frequent opportunities of defending the great principles of
American Independence; encouraging the arts and chastising the enemies
of the federal constitution whatever mask they may wear or whatever
denomination they may assume.”

Further along in his address to the people, Burk apologized for calling
the residents of Boston his fellow-citizens, but, he added, he was their
fellow citizen, for the moment a stranger puts his foot on American soil
“his fetters,” to use his own language, “are rent to pieces.”

In concluding his leading editorial, Burk said: “The _Polar Star_, like
a stern and impartial tribune of criticism, shall be open to reasoning
on both sides, but it will hear only reasoning. It will curb the spirit
of faction; silence the clamor of revenge and heal the wounds of the
unfortunate.”

Burk complained of the treatment accorded him by the other Boston papers
of the period. In a paragraph, one day, he called attention to the fact
that none deigned to notice the _Polar Star_, and remarked that if its
promoters had not taken the trouble to register its birth in the temple
of freedom, the world would not have been the wiser.

In another issue, he calls attention to the fact that “a gentleman
possessing the wisdom of a Socrates,” declined to subscribe to his
paper, “because the editor was an _Irishman_.” The italics are Burk’s.

The _Polar Star and Daily Advertiser_ gave each political party an equal
showing in its news columns, but its editor early incurred the enmity of
President Adams. Of the presidential canvass preceding the election of
John Adams, who was the candidate of the Federalists, Editor Burk
observed in his paper:

“We hope the future president will be as good a Republican as
Washington. Never has the venerable patriot been known to utter a
sentiment favorable to royalty. He ought to be a friend to the
revolution of Holland and France; he ought not to be willing to divide
the people by any distinction; Americans should have but one
denomination—the people.”

It would seem that President Adams kept a sharp eye on Burk while in
Boston. It was his intention, says Burk’s son in his memoirs of his
father, to hand the Boston editor over to the captain of a British
frigate lying in Boston harbor. Great Britain at that time was claiming
all her subjects, wherever found. Many an American vessel was searched
for escaped Irish patriots, and on this right of search, the war of 1812
was waged. Had Burk ever been handed over to the British captain, there
is no doubt but that he would have been hanged at the yard arm of the
vessel. As it was, Burk was obliged to flee from Boston, fearing
surrender to the British, leaving his daily paper on the hands of the
printer, who soon afterwards abandoned it and removed to Philadelphia,
then the seat of the Federal government.

It was Aaron Burr who gave Burk the first intimation of President Adams’
intention to turn him over to the British authorities, and in more ways
than one Hamilton’s inveterate political enemy facilitated Burk’s escape
to New York, where he published _The Time-Piece_. Thus, Boston lost a
brilliant man and her first daily paper was reluctantly abandoned after
six months’ existence.

While in Boston, Burk married a widow named Curtis, formerly Christine
Borne. She bore him one son, John Junius Burk, who became a
distinguished jurist of Louisiana. Mrs. Curtis had two boys by her first
marriage. One of them married a sister of President John Tyler. John
Junius Burk left several accomplished children who were justly proud of
John Daly Burk, their grandfather, the pioneer of Boston daily
journalism. After his New York experience Burk took up his residence
among the Republicans of Virginia. Jefferson, Randolph and other
distinguished patriots were proud to have him in their company. He wrote
one of the best histories of Virginia published, and took an active part
in public matters, being in great demand for public speaking.

In the _Richmond Enquirer_ of May 27, 1808, were printed proposals for
publishing the ancient and modern music of Ireland, by John McCreery and
Skelton Jones. Burk wrote a fine essay on the subject for the work. This
book, it is said, suggested to Thomas Moore his Irish melodies. Dr.
Robinson, who wrote the preface to McCreery’s work, was a classmate of
Moore at Trinity College, Dublin. Burk’s ending was dramatic. He was
killed in a duel by a Frenchman in Virginia in 1808. Although Burk was
the publisher of the first daily paper in Boston, the impartial
historians of the Hub dismiss him by a mere mention of his name when
they condescend to refer to his paper at all, but an honored son has
preserved the important facts of his distinguished and interesting
career.

A most interesting character in pioneer journalism in America was Andrew
Brown, an Irishman who published the _Federal Gazette_ in Philadelphia.
He, too, was a graduate of Trinity college. He came to America when a
young man, settled in Massachusetts, and fought on the patriots’ side at
Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill. He took an active part in the
campaigns of Generals Gates and Greene.

Brown’s paper was the first to publish reports of the doings of
Congress. He upheld the constitution when it was assailed, and earned
the gratitude of men no less distinguished than Washington.

Another of the early Irish-American publishers was John Dunlap of the
_Pennsylvania Packet_, the first daily published in America. He was born
in Strabane, Ireland, in 1747. He died in Philadelphia in November,
1812. He was the first congressional printer, and acted as such to the
Continental Congress. His paper was first to print the Declaration of
Independence. He was an officer in the First Philadelphia cavalry which
acted as Washington’s body-guard at Trenton and Princeton. Dunlap was an
intense patriot, and during the Revolutionary War contributed more than
£4,000 to the support of the Revolutionary army. He was a member of that
noble band, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, of Philadelphia, which
furnished more field officers to the Revolutionary army and rendered
more material aid to the colonists in the struggle for independence than
any other single society.

Another prominent Philadelphia journalist of Irish birth was Mathew
Carey, a native of Dublin. He landed in Philadelphia November 15, 1784.
He had just been released from an English prison for political offenses.
Two months later he issued the _Philadelphia Herald_. The _Herald_ was
the first paper to give correct legislative reports of Congress, Carey
acting as his own reporter. For his vigorous opposition to English
tyranny in his native land, he found himself one day a prisoner behind
the bars at Newgate. Previous to this he was obliged to flee, for a
vigorous use of his able pen in behalf of Irish freedom. He went to
Paris and there made the acquaintance of the American minister, Benjamin
Franklin, who gave him employment as clerk in the American embassy.
After a year’s absence he returned to Dublin. He and Franklin were
life-long friends, and it was he, I believe, who remarked to Franklin
one day, that he agreed with the great philosopher in everything except
religion.

He remained at his post editing his paper during the yellow fever
epidemic in Philadelphia, when all other editors felt obliged to desert
their posts. He wrote and published much on economic and political
subjects. His articles on protection were translated into different
languages, and had a large sale. He fought a duel with Colonel Oswald,
editor of a rival journal, and was confined to his bed for sixteen
months, the result of wounds received from his antagonist. Mathew Carey
was the first publisher of an American history. It was written by an
Irish Presbyterian, Dr. Ramsay.

Perhaps the most interesting character among the Philadelphia editors of
Irish blood was William Duane. He was the editor of the _Aurora_. Born
in New York of Irish parents, he was sent to Ireland to be educated,
graduating at Trinity College with honors. In 1794 we find him in India
where he started a paper called the _World_ and accumulated quite a
fortune. With his inherent love of freedom, Duane championed the cause
of the colonists against the East India Company. He was invited to
breakfast one day with the governor of the colony, was arrested and sent
to London in irons without any explanation. After petitioning for
redress he awaited the outcome. Meanwhile he was employed editing the
_General Advertiser_, which was subsequently merged into the _London
Times_.

In 1795 Duane gave up his hope of redress from the Company and left
London in disgust, coming to Philadelphia, where he became the editor of
the _Aurora_, the leading organ of the Democratic party. It was to him
that Jefferson attributed his election, owing to the vigorous advocacy
of his candidacy through the _Aurora_ columns which at that time was
regarded as the most influential paper in America. President Jefferson
made him a lieutenant-colonel in 1805, and during the war of 1812 he was
adjutant-general of the army, which afforded the editor of the _Aurora_
an opportunity to retaliate on his old enemy, England. The change of the
seat of government from Philadelphia to Washington, diminished the
influence of his paper, and later he retired from its editorship. He
traveled much after retirement from his editorial labors, and on his
return from abroad devoted himself to literary pursuits. He published a
great many works on military subjects.

His son, who was born in Ireland, was originally a printer and paper
dealer in Philadelphia. He studied law, was admitted to practice and
represented Philadelphia in the state legislature for many years. He,
like his father, took a deep interest in public matters, especially the
building up of the great common school system of Philadelphia. He was
his father’s right hand man in his editorial labors and secretary of the
treasury in 1833 under President Jackson. He was removed from his
position by the president after a controversy, for his refusal to remove
the deposits from the United States bank during the exciting bank
troubles. He was an author of note and wrote much on political and
economic subjects.

The Binns family who settled in Philadelphia at the close of the
eighteenth century were natives of Dublin. John and Benjamin were
printers. John was tried in England for “treason,” but escaped
punishment. Soon after his acquittal he was rearrested on a similar
charge and served three years in jail. He came to America in 1801. In
1802 he commenced the publication of the _Republican Argus_ at
Northumberland, Penn., and in 1807 issued the _Democratic Press_ at
Philadelphia. For many years it was a most influential paper. For twenty
years John Binn was an alderman of the city of Philadelphia, and was
always active in matters affecting his native land. He was the first man
to print an absolutely correct copy of the Declaration of Independence.
For this public service he received the thanks of John Quincy Adams and
General Lafayette. Appended to the copy of the document was a fac simile
of the signatures of the signers of the immortal Declaration.

The proprietor of the _New Jersey State Gazette_ which was established
in 1792, the first daily paper published in that state, was William B.
Kenny, the son of Irish parents. Under President Fillmore he was
American minister to Sardinia.

Dr. James Hagan, the fighting editor of the _Vicksburg_ (Miss.)
_Sentinel_, was one of the earliest daily newspaper men in the South. He
was killed in the prime of life while on his way to his office one day
in 1842, by the editor of the _Vicksburg Whig_, with whom he had had a
controversy. Dr. Hagan’s associate in the enterprise was James Ryan.

In the early life of the nineteenth century we find Henry O’Reilly
editing the _New York Columbian_. At seventeen he was editor of the
_Patriot_, ably advocating, in 1842, the election of DeWitt Clinton, an
Irish immigrant’s son, as governor of the Empire state. In 1826 the
_Rochester Daily Advertiser_ was issued and was the first daily between
the Hudson river and the Pacific Ocean. O’Reilly was then only
twenty-one years old, but was considered one of the ablest men in his
profession at that time. He was a great advocate of the canal system of
New York and was always ready to defend it from the attacks of designing
politicians. He was one of the foremost champions of the great common
school system of his state. To him belongs the credit of the
establishment of the State Agricultural college. Almost every state in
the Union has followed New York’s lead in this matter. As a promoter of
the infant telegraph business, Mr. O’Reilly is acknowledged to have been
the foremost man in the matter, assisting Morse with his pen and money.
No man had more influence than O’Reilly throughout the state, and at the
breaking out of the Rebellion he did yeoman service for the Union cause.
He died in 1867, loved and respected by all.

William Cassidy, the son of Irish parents, was born in Albany, N. Y., in
1815. His father was a great friend of DeWitt Clinton, the governor of
New York. Cassidy was the editor of the _Albany Atlas_ and _Argus_ which
were united in 1856, taking the name of the _Argus_. From that date the
_Albany Argus_ has been one of the leading papers of New York state.
Cassidy was a fine classical scholar, and for many years secretary of
the Democratic state committee. He was a noted platform builder and
often helped his party out of trying positions.

James McCarroll was a noted journalist of his day. He was born in the
county Longford, Ireland, came to this country when a young man, and in
1845 was a proprietor of the _Peterboro Chronicle_. Later in life he was
engaged as a musical and dramatic critic on New York daily papers. His
father fell, fighting bravely for the Union, at Antietam.

Who is there that does not recall Fitz James O’Brien and his heroism on
Union battlefields, that won him the official praise of two great
generals? He lived a newspaper man, a poet, and a writer of preëminent
ability. He died a Union soldier. He gave his life to his adopted
country freely and without price. A record of heroic deeds on the
battlefields survives him. Of him, suffice it to say, that during his
ten years’ residence in America, this adopted citizen brought out some
of the most brilliant writings of their class published. He died in
Virginia, an aide in the staff of General Landers, from the effects of a
wound received in a charge he led, and lies buried in Greenwood
cemetery, New York, in an honored grave.

The mention of poor O’Brien recalls to mind Charles Dawson Shanley,
another Irishman, who died in 1875. For eighteen years Mr. Shanley
occupied a prominent place in American journalism, having been connected
with several New York newspapers as editor and contributor. His poems
and novels still delight the lover of realistic beauty. His old friend,
William Winter, paid this tribute to him in the columns of the _New York
Tribune_, April 19, 1875: “There is no one of the busy workers in
journalism who will not be benefited by reflection upon a character so
pure and simple, a life so industrious, useful and blameless, and an end
so tranquil.”

Col. James Mulligan once edited a Chicago paper. General Thomas Francis
Meagher, of ’48 fame, was editing the _Irish News_ in New York at the
breaking out of the Rebellion of ’61.

Robert S. McKenzie, a native of Limerick, Ireland, a graduate of Fermoy,
was noted for his literary work, and was engaged in general newspaper
correspondence for many years.

One of the most successful journalists of Irish blood was Thomas
Kinsella, editor of the _Brooklyn Eagle_. Mr. Kinsella was born in
Ireland in 1832, learned his trade as a printer and in 1861 was editing
the _Brooklyn Eagle_. He was postmaster at Brooklyn, member of Congress,
one of the original Brooklyn bridge trustees, and at one time president
of the St. Patrick club of Brooklyn.

In Indiana, no two newspaper men of their time were better known than
Thomas and John Dowling in the early part of the nineteenth century.

A son of Judge John D. Phelan of Tennessee, who graduated with high
honor at Nashville University, started a Democratic paper in
Huntersville, conducting it with success. Editor Phelan was a leading
figure in politics and at his death was a judge of the supreme court of
Tennessee.

Michael Burnham was the name of the man, who, when the century was
young, issued the _New York Post_ and _Herald_.

Although the founder of the _New York Herald_, James Gordon Bennett, was
of Scotch birth, his mother was an Irishwoman, being the descendant of
an old and honorable Dublin family. Mr. Bennett studied for the
priesthood in the old country, but soon abandoned the idea, came to
Boston where he read proof for a while, and after a varied experience in
newspaper life settled in New York and in 1835 started the _New York
Herald_.

James Gordon Bennett’s great competitor, Horace Greeley, of the _New
York Tribune_, was a New Hampshire boy, born of Irish parents in the
town of Amherst. No man carried more influence than Greeley, and in the
days of the war and the decade following it the _Tribune_ was a great
power in national politics.

One of the foremost newspaper men of the South was the late United
States Senator Patrick Walsh of Georgia. He was a native of Limerick. He
came to America with his parents when a child. He was a hard worker in
his youth and earned enough money sticking type to pay his way at
Georgetown college. He was at college when his adopted state seceded and
he went home to join the Meagher Guard, an Irish company attached to the
first regiment of South Carolina. He had filled every position on the
paper, and in 1873 became one of the owners of the _Augusta Chronicle_.

Few journalists in America occupy the high position in their profession
that Col. Alexander Kelly McClure, who, with the McLaughlin brothers,
started the _Philadelphia Times_, one of the leading papers in the
country to-day. Mr. McClure comes from the Pennsylvania Irish which has
furnished so many remarkable men in American history. He has been an
important factor in journalism for nearly half a century now and counts
among his nearest friends the leading men of the nation. He was
particularly prominent in the War of the Rebellion and was on the most
intimate terms with President Lincoln.

As a war correspondent Joseph B. McCullagh, late editor of the _St.
Louis Globe-Democrat_, had few equals. He was a native of Dublin, which
he early left, coming to America when a boy. He had a varied and
successful newspaper career. He was in the Wilderness with Grant and
with Sherman on his march to the sea. In his campaign with Grant a
friendship was formed which lasted until the death of the hero of the
Rebellion.

One of the leading newspaper men of Pittsburg to-day is Thomas J.
Keenan, the son of an Irish-American soldier distinguished for his
bravery. Mr. Keenan recently gave a $30,000 home to the newsboys of
Pittsburg.

Thomas Fitzgerald, for many years connected with the New York
_Commercial Advertiser_, and the _Item_, of Philadelphia, which he
founded, was in his day one of the leaders in American journalism. He
died in 1891, after turning his paper over to his son. He was a noted
dramatist, and during the War of the Rebellion was an intense patriot.
He was a noted public speaker. Charles Sumner said of a speech of his
delivered in Boston, that it was one of the best extemporaneous
addresses he had ever listened to.

At the head of the _Scranton_ (Pa.) _Truth_ is James Joseph Jordan, born
of Irish parents, while the Farrells of Albany, N. Y., are also
well-known and influential in the newspaper world.

The late Joseph Medill, of Chicago, the son of Irish parents, made the
_Chicago Tribune_ a great newspaper. He ranked with Charles A. Dana of
the _N. Y. Sun_.

Thomas O’Conor, the father of New York’s greatest jurist, Charles
O’Conor, was among the best known and gifted newspaper men in the early
’40’s.

Theodore O’Hara, the gifted poet of the South, was a newspaper man of
wide experience. Himself a Kentucky soldier, he wrote the beautiful poem
entitled “The Bivouac of the Dead,” when the remains of the Kentucky
soldiers who fell at Buena Vista in the Mexican War were brought home to
their native state. Lines from his poems are inscribed over the
entrances of several of the national cemeteries. By a resolution of the
Kentucky legislature, his remains were conveyed from Georgia, where he
died, to his native state and they now lie beside those whom he had
commemorated in his beautiful lines, and beside whom he had fought the
battles of his country.

Daniel Kane O’Donnell as an all round newspaper man and a war
correspondent, had few equals. He represented the _Philadelphia Press_
on Sherman’s march to the sea. After the war he became connected with
the _New York Tribune_, and was made correspondent of the paper in
Mexico, and later in Cuba, his interesting letters attracting world-wide
attention. Subsequently, he returned to the home office and was given
charge of the foreign affairs of the paper.

At the head of the war correspondents of the Orient and Europe stands
Januarius Aloysius McGahan, an Irish-American journalist. His first
notable newspaper connection was as the Paris correspondent of the _New
York Herald_. McGahan was about to return from Europe after a course in
international law, when he was retained by Mr. Bennett as the _Herald_
correspondent.

He overtook the retreating Frenchmen at Bordeaux and accompanied them to
Lyons, sending graphic dispatches to his paper in the form of interviews
with the leaders of all parties. This surprised the European newspapers,
as it was the introduction of newspaper interviewing in the old world.
He was the only correspondent who remained in Paris during the commune,
and kept the readers of the _Herald_ thoroughly informed as to what was
going on in the turbulent French capital. He was arrested by the French
government for intimacy with the rebels, but through the intercession of
the American minister was released.

After this he was made correspondent at St. Petersburg by the _Herald_,
and was on the most intimate terms with the czar. He was at the
bombardment of Khiva, and in 1874 reported the Carlist war, living in
the saddle and being frequently under fire. To follow McGahan would
require a whole evening. He continued to be the most renowned
correspondent of his day, and died of fever at his post of duty during
the Bulgarian war in 1875.

Another famous _New York Herald_ war correspondent was James O’Kelly,
who made a world-wide reputation in his dispatches from Cuba in the
early ’70’s. Born in Ireland, a French soldier in Mexico, he came to
America and engaged in the newspaper business, becoming an attache of
the _New York Herald_. He was condemned to death for his part in the
Cuban insurrection, but was saved that fate by the state department.
After his release he returned to Ireland, and was elected to parliament
on entering politics.

It was Daniel O’Neil, a native of Wexford, who started the _Pittsburg
Dispatch_, one of the leading papers of the West to-day. His brother,
Eugene O’Neil, is now the editor.

Ex-Mayor Hugh O’Brien, of Boston, scored a signal success as a
journalist.

James McConnell, who died recently, was one of the best known newspaper
men of Philadelphia. He learned to set type at the case adjoining that
of the late John Russell Young. Later, he became proofreader on the
_Philadelphia Press_, then owned by John Forney. He became night editor,
and during the Civil War war correspondent of that paper. When John
Russell Young became managing editor of the _New York Tribune_ under
Horace Greeley, Mr. McConnell came to New York and while with the
_Tribune_ was successively day editor, Albany correspondent, traveling
political correspondent, night editor and political editor in the
office. After serving the _Tribune_ he went to Philadelphia and
associated himself with the _Evening Star_, and at the time of his death
was managing editor of the _Star_.

Add to this already remarkable list, a Grady in the South, a Blaine in
the North. Nothing that I might say regarding these distinguished men of
Irish origin would add to the already large stock of knowledge possessed
by the public concerning them. Their names are household words. They
lived but as yesterday. Their influence is still felt.

In treating a subject of this character one could hardly forget the debt
of gratitude the Irish people in America owe to Patrick Donahoe, the
venerable founder of the _Boston Pilot_, and his brilliant and scholarly
successor as editor of that paper, the lamented John Boyle O’Reilly.
Coming down to the present time, we would not be doing justice to
ourselves did we not pause in admiration of the present gifted editor of
the _Pilot_, James Jeffrey Roche, and also of Stephen O’Meara, the
manager of the _Boston Journal_. Time permits only a passing notice of
these brilliant lights in American journalism. In this hasty review of
the men of Irish blood who have taken such an active part in American
newspaper work, I doubt not that many worthy men have escaped notice. It
is inevitable in such an undertaking. Experience teaches that if one
were to put the works on the Irish in America together, something and
somebody would be missing.

Enough has been shown to establish the fact that Irishmen by birth or
blood may justly claim a large share of putting the American newspaper
on its feet, so to speak. This is not said in any boastful vein. The
only desire is to show that in the building up of this great industry
Irishmen did their share of the work. Effort has been made to keep
within the bounds of actual facts, most of them being obtained from
unwilling witnesses, men who, when they are forced to include in their
chronicles men of our race, endeavor oftentimes to make them out
“Scotch-Irish.”

Men like Burk, Carey, Dunlap, Brown and Duane may have been
“adventurists and refugees.” God grant us more such “adventurists and
refugees,” for they lived useful lives here. They left their imprint on
the land. The historian who would apply the term “adventurists and
refugees” to such men should reflect that, had the American cause
failed, Washington, Adams, Jefferson and many other patriots would have
come within their term of “adventurists and refugees,” and probably
would have been seeking liberty elsewhere, as were these men, far from
the land of their nativity.

These pioneers in American journalism came here,

          “Where no caste barrier stays the poor man’s son,
            Till step by step the topmost height is won;
          Where every hand subscribes to every rule,
            And free as air are voice, and vote, and school.”

“They may sleep in their silent tomb,” to quote the words of Thomas
D’Arcy Magee, another brilliant Irish-American journalist, “but the
remembrance of their virtue will be cherished while liberty is dear to
the American heart.”

A distinguished man, Gen. Patrick A. Collins, once observed that of all
the brilliant Irishmen he ever knew—and he has known many—John Boyle
O’Reilly and D’Arcy Magee could do more things and do them better than
any of their contemporaries.




                IRISH PIONEERS AND BUILDERS OF KENTUCKY.

                      BY HON. JOHN C. LINEHAN.[22]


The number of distinctive Irish names met in looking over the early
records of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, and Kentucky is
simply wonderful. When are added to them the names more distinctively
Scotch, but fully as Gaelic in origin as the Irish, one is justified in
believing what Ramsay wrote in 1789, that:

“The colonies which now form the United States may be considered as
Europe transplanted. Ireland, England, Scotland, France, Germany,
Holland, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, and Italy furnished the original
stock of the present population and have been supposed to contribute to
it in the order enumerated. For the last seventy or eighty years no
nation has contributed so much to the population of America as
Ireland.”[23]

Dr. Hart and William Coomes were the first Catholic settlers in
Kentucky, locating in Harrodsburgh in 1775. The doctor was the first
medical practitioner in the state, as Mrs. Coomes was the first teacher.
This credit is given them in Collins’ History of Kentucky. Among the
fortified stations or forts built for protection from the Indians by the
early settlers, not a few bore names familiar to Irish ears, denoting
the presence of many of the old race.

Among them may be mentioned Bryan’s Station, Dougherty’s Station,
Drennan’s Lick, Feagan’s Station, Finn’s Station, Fleming’s Station,
Hart’s Station, Higgins’ Block House, Irish Station, Lynch’s Station,
Logan’s Fort, McAfee’s Station, McFadden’s Station, McGee’s Station,
Sullivan’s Old Station, Sullivan’s New Station, Sullivan’s Station,
Daniel Sullivan’s Station, McGuire’s Station, McCormack’s Station,
McKeenan’s Station, McConnell’s Station, Kennedy’s Station, Givin’s
Station, McKinley’s Station, McMillan’s Station, Owen’s Station, Kilgore
Station, Hoy Station, Kinchelloe’s Station and Gilmore’s Station.

Ten Kentucky counties bear Irish names: Adair, Butler, Logan, Hart,
Montgomery, McCracken, Boyle, Carroll, Rowan, and Casey. John Carty, the
most successful merchant in Lexington, was the son of John Carty, a
native of Ireland who went early to Kentucky from New Jersey; and
General James Morrison, for many years one of the leading men of the
state, was the son of another Irish emigrant.

As late as 1840, among the surviving veterans of the Revolutionary War
residing in Kentucky were the following:

 James McElroy,
 Andrew Linam,
 James McElhaney,
 Michael Moore,
 William Brady,

 Gen. Richard Butler,
 Maj. John Finley,
 Col. James Morrison.

The following served in the several companies named, during the
Revolution, on detached service, mainly against the Indians, who were
the auxiliaries of the British:

In Captain Bourman’s company,—William Barry, Edward Bulger, Patrick
Doran, Isaac McBride, Robert McClanahan, Edward Murray, Joseph Michael
and Thomas Pendergast.

Captain Logan’s company,—Capt. Benj. Logan, Lieut. John Logan, William
Casey, George Flynn, Bartholomew Fenton, Stephen Houston, John
McCormack, John McElhone, James McElwain, John McKaine, Archibald
Mahone, William Neal.

Captain Harrod’s company,—Daniel Driskill, John Conway, Patrick McGee,
John Lewis, William Smiley, James Sullivan, James Welch.

Captain Boyle’s company,—Capt. John Boyle, Barney Boyle, Elisha Clary,
James Coyle, Owen Devine, Peter Higgins, Robert Moore, William Rowan,
Dennis Devine.

Captain Holder’s company,—James Barry, James Bryan, John Butler, William
Collins, William McGee, Hugh Ross.

Captain Boone’s company,—John Butler, Patrick Ryan, Morgan Hughes, John
McFadden.

An idea can be formed of the Irish blood in Kentucky during those
stirring times, from the character of the names given. Nearly all the
great Gaelic family names are represented, and the absence of Scriptural
(Old Testament) names, so common among those of the Presbyterian and
Congregational denominations, indicates that these men were of Catholic
stock when they, or their fathers, immigrated. The first settlers of the
“Blue Grass” state were from Virginia, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania,—nearly all of this stock, which no doubt accounts for the
gallantry and beauty of the modern Kentuckians, men and women, and the
superior quality of the whiskey and horses, for the usquebaugh, or
“mountain dew,” was first distilled in Ireland, and when first tasted by
the sluggish Saxons, the effect was such on their thick blood, muddied
by beer, that they considered it good not only as a beverage, but as
“cure-all” for medicinal purposes.

James McBride, an Irishman, has the credit of being the first white man
to enter the territory, “paddling his canoe up the Kentucky river in
1745.” Twenty years later Col. George Croghan, the well-known Indian
agent of the same stock, was at Shawane town, on the Ohio river.

When Daniel Boone left North Carolina for Kentucky in 1769, he was
accompanied by James Mooney, John Stewart, Joseph Holden, John Findlay
and William Cool, all but the leader being of Irish stock.

In 1775, James, George and Robert McAfee, and James McCowen went to the
territory on a surveying tour. In 1778 Capt. James Grattan, John Tuel
and John McManus were among those who laid the permanent foundation of
the city of Louisville. Bryan’s station was one of the earliest
garrisons for protection against the Indians, and two of the prominent
Indian fighters were Captains Orr and Shannon.

Captain Flynn was one of the founders of the town of Columbia, 1787, and
Dr. John Connelly was agent in 1778 for the British government in the
territory. The first newspaper established northwest of the Ohio, in
Cincinnati, was by William Maxwell, of the same stock.

Col. John Lutteral, an Irishman, was one of a party which left North
Carolina for Boonesboro’, Ky., in April, 1775. He was one of the
pioneers and a noted man for years. He was accompanied by John Hart and
John Kennedy. Daniel Boone was the leader. Captain Flynn, who has been
mentioned as one of the founders of Columbia, had as associates Francis
Dunleavy and John Riley.

Among the first settlers of Harrodsburgh were the families of McGarry
and Hogan, welcome acquisitions on account of their wives and children.
Major McGarry was one of the bravest, as well as one of the best known,
Indian fighters in Kentucky, having for an associate a brother Celt
named Major McBride, and another named Captain Bulger. The recital of
their deeds would alone fill a good-sized volume.

In an attack on Bryan’s station, a garrison named after another Celt, by
a party of 500 Indians, in 1782, the savages were repulsed, but some of
the women were killed. This enraged the whites in the vicinity, and a
party of 160 met at the station to arrange for the pursuit and
punishment of the Indians. The cooler heads, led by Daniel Boone, tried
to dissuade the hotheads from making the attempt, but in the midst of
the discussion the impetuous McGarry, putting spurs to his horse, cried
out for all but the cowards to follow him, and galloped in the direction
taken by the savage foe. Every man of the 160, nettled by the taunt,
followed him, but the result which was predicted, followed. They fell
into an ambuscade and sixty of the number were killed, among them
McBride and Bulger. McGarry fought like a madman and escaped unhurt.

Among the first Presbyterian ministers in the state were James McCready,
William McGill, Samuel McAdoo, Henry Delaney, A. M. Bryan, William
McGee, William McMahon and John Dunleavy; and among the first Methodist
ministers were James O’Cull, William Burke, William McMahon and John and
William McGee, all Irish enough in appearance to be staunch Catholics of
the old Milesian type, and it is not unlikely their fathers may have
been.

Among those who distinguished themselves in the history of the state as
legislators, soldiers or writers, were Wm. T. Barry, who was chief
justice of the court of appeals in 1825; one of a commission to digest a
plan of schools for common education; lieutenant-governor in 1820;
member of the National House of Representatives in 1810‒’11; and in the
United States Senate in 1814‒’16.

Gen. John Adair held high command in the War of 1812‒’15; received the
thanks of the Kentucky legislature for gallantry at New Orleans; was
governor of Kentucky in 1820; in the National House of Representatives
1814‒’16, and had served in the United States Senate in 1805‒’06. John
Rowan was secretary of state in 1804; Benjamin Logan was presidential
elector in 1793, William Logan in 1809, and Robert Ewing, William
Irvine, William Casey and William Logan in 1813.

The indomitable Matthew Lyon who went from Vermont to Kentucky was again
sent from Kentucky to congress in 1829‒’33‒’35, and his son, Chittenden
Lyon, was there in 1827‒’35. Colonel Chittenden Lyon was a veritable
giant in size, being considerably over six feet in height and weighing
over 350 pounds. The admixture of Irish and Yankee blood in his make-up,
if anything, increased the pugnacious spirit inherited from his father,
who had married one of the Vermont Chittendens; and the stories told of
his prowess as a wrestler and a boxer are countless.

Being at one time a candidate for a public office, when the margin was
close, he was approached by a political opponent, his rival in
fisticuffs as well as in politics, and fully his equal in size and
weight, and challenged to a boxing match, the condition being that the
loser would vote for the winner. This Lyon agreed to, and they went at
it, over 700 pounds of bone and muscle. After a severe contest the
spectators interfered and it was declared a draw, Lyon, however,
receiving his rival’s vote.

Thomas Dougherty was clerk of the House of Representatives in 1815.
Among native Kentuckians who served in Congress from other states were
James B. Foley from Indiana, 1857‒’59; Willis A. Gorman from the same
state, 1849‒’53, and also a major-general in the Civil War; Edward A.
Hannegan from the same state, in 1855‒’57; and Cornelius L. L. Leary
from Maryland.

Among the noted military men of the Irish stock were Generals John
Boyle, Adair, Croghan and Commander Prendergast.

Among Kentucky poets were Dr. John M. Harney, brother to Gen. W. S.
Harney, Theodore O’Hara, Gen. W. O. Butler, W. D. Gallagher, Noble
Butler and William M. Harney. Among legislators and educators, in
addition to those already named, were McNamara, Hogan, Kane O’Hara, “the
great educator” and father of Colonel Theodore, the poet; Judge James
O’Hara, brother to Kane, and Major James O’Hara, son of the Judge. John
McGill, James McGinty, Cassidy, O’Bamon, Kennan and Finley were also
honored names in the “dark and bloody ground.”

Michael Cassidy, born in Ireland and a soldier of the Revolution, went
to Kentucky in 1782. He was small in stature, being barely five feet in
height, but he made up in courage what he lacked in size, and was, in
addition, as tough and wiry as a hickory sapling. He was considered one
of the most noted Indian fighters in his day, and many anecdotes have
been printed about him.

Dr. John M. Harney, mentioned elsewhere, went to Kentucky from Delaware.
He was born in 1789. He was the son of Major Thomas Harney. Major
Benjamin F. Harney was an elder brother. In 1847 he was the senior
surgeon in the United States army. A younger brother was Major-General
W. S. Harney, who distinguished himself in the Florida and Mexican War.
He was prominent for a while at the outbreak of the Civil War, being in
command at St. Louis until relieved by General Fremont.

Dr. John M. Harney married the daughter of another Celt, the celebrated
John Rowan, in his day one of the best known and respected men in
Kentucky. In his latter years Dr. Harney returned to the faith of his
fathers, dying in the Catholic fold at Bardstown, the original seat of
Catholicity in Kentucky, on January 15, 1825. Gen. John Adair, for whom
the county of that name was called, was born in South Carolina in 1757.
He served in the Revolutionary War. He was one of Kentucky’s pioneers
and first citizens. His name denotes his origin.

Daniel Boone, it is said, was a descendant of one of the original
Catholic settlers of Maryland. Let that be as it may, some of the name
are still found in Maryland, who cling to the old faith. His is the
greatest name among the early pioneers of the state. Boyle county was
named for the Hon. John Boyle, for many years chief justice of Kentucky,
who was a native of Virginia. Butler county received its name from
Major-General Richard Butler of Pennsylvania, who fought through the
Revolutionary War and was killed in St. Clair’s disastrous defeat,
November 4, 1791.

Few of the prominent families, not only of Kentucky but of any state in
the Union, have been so distinguished in many ways as this of General
Butler. The emigrant ancestor was Thomas Butler, born in Kilkenny,
Ireland, April 8, 1720. Five of his sons attained eminence in America.
Of these, Richard, William and Thomas were, like their father, natives
of Ireland. Percival and Edward were born in Pennsylvania. All were
officers in the Revolutionary War. Edward was too young at first, but
entered it before its close. Richard was the second in command of
Morgan’s rifle regiment. He was afterwards its colonel and commanded
Wayne’s left in the attack on Stony Point. All these brothers and their
immediate descendants were engaged in the military service of their
country, in all the wars before 1800; while their survivors were in the
war of 1812, and not less than nine of a younger generation were in the
Mexican War.

Gen. Percival Butler migrated to Kentucky in 1784. His son, Col. Thomas
L. Butler, was aide to General Jackson in the battle of New Orleans. A
second son, Gen. Wm. O. Butler, also served in the war of 1812, received
the commendations of General Jackson for bravery at New Orleans, was
afterwards appointed on Jackson’s staff and was a major-general in the
Mexican War. The third son, Richard P. Butler, was assistant
adjutant-general in the campaign of 1812.

Campbell county takes its name from Col. John Campbell, a native of
Ireland. He received a grant of four thousand acres of land, located
near Louisville, and during life was one of Kentucky’s noted men.
Carroll county takes its name from Charles Carroll, of Carrollton.

Casey county derives its name from Col. Thomas Casey, who went from
Virginia to Kentucky in 1779. Daviess county was named in honor of
Joseph H. Daviess, who fell at Tippecanoe. He was born in Virginia, of
an Irish father and a Scotch mother. “The warm heart, free and off-hand,
and ready sentiment told in language plainer than words, that the blood
of Erin flowed fresh in his veins.”

Fleming county was named for Col. John Fleming, who was born in
Virginia. Fulton county was named for Robert Fulton. Hart county derived
its name from Capt. N. G. T. Hart. His father, Col. Thomas Hart, was
from Maryland. Kenton county takes its name from the celebrated Simon
Kenton. “His father was an Irishman, his mother of Scotch descent.” He
was born in Virginia. His name is familiar to every reader of the early
history of Kentucky.

Knox county was named for Gen. Henry Knox of the Revolution. He was born
in Boston of Irish parents, and was a member of “The Irish Society” of
that city. Logan county derives its name from Gen. Benjamin Logan. His
parents came from Ireland. He was born in Pennsylvania. His is one of
Kentucky’s great names. It is claimed that his son, William Logan, was
the first white child born in Kentucky. McCracken county was named for
Capt. Virgil McCracken, who was killed in the war of 1812. Meade county
was named for Capt. James Meade, who was killed in the same engagement
with Captain McCracken. Montgomery county derives its name from Gen.
Richard Montgomery, who was killed at Quebec. Wayne county was named in
honor of Gen. Anthony Wayne, who was born in Pennsylvania. His name
appears on the roll of members of the “Friendly Sons of St. Patrick” of
Philadelphia.

Another noted Kentucky family was that of the O’Haras. Kane O’Hara went
to Kentucky in the latter part of the eighteenth century, and became in
time one of its most distinguished educators. He was accompanied to this
country by his father and two younger brothers. Of the two latter,
Charles went to Georgia, where he followed the same profession; James
remained in Kentucky teaching for some years, but later was admitted to
the bar, and acquired the reputation of a profound lawyer and able
advocate.

He was the father of Judge James O’Hara, Jr. Among the large number of
pupils of Kane O’Hara who became famous after, were several of the
Marshalls and Browns,—Major Croghan of the United States army, and
President Zachary Taylor. When on his way to Washington to be
inaugurated, General Taylor departed from his line of travel in order to
visit his old teacher in Frankfort. “It was an affecting scene when the
great soldier, then an old man, bowed himself in grateful homage before
the venerable preceptor of his youth, and in few but earnest words,
thanked him for the care bestowed on his early education, to which he
attributed all the achievements of his after life.”

Col. Theodore O’Hara, poet, journalist, and soldier, was the son of Kane
O’Hara. He was educated by his father with the greatest care, but
received his collegiate finish, and graduated, at St. Joseph’s College,
Bardstown, with the first honors of his class. His “Bivouac of the Dead”
has made his name immortal:

                “The muffled drum’s sad roll has beat
                The soldier’s last tattoo!
                No more on life’s parade shall meet
                That brave and fallen few;
                On fame’s eternal camping-ground
                Their silent tents are spread,
                And Glory guards with solemn round
                The bivouac of the dead.

                       *       *       *       *       *

                Rest on, embalmed and sainted dead!
                Dear as the blood ye gave;
                No impious footsteps here shall tread
                The herbage of your graves;
                Nor shall your glory be forgot
                While Fame her record keeps,
                Or honor points the hallowed spot
                Where valor proudly sleeps.”

A great and magnanimous government has had these verses, the composition
of an ex-Confederate soldier, cast separately in bronze and set up in
appropriate places in all the National cemeteries.

It is worthy of mention that a lady bearing a now historic name, at
least in song, Mrs. Ann McGinty, brought the first spinning-wheel into
Kentucky, and made the first linen in the territory. She is also
credited with making the first butter there, and with bringing within
its borders the first chickens, ducks and hogs. The first Catholic
priest in Kentucky was Father Whalen, who was in Bardstown in 1787.
There were then fifty Catholic families in the state. The first families
to settle there were those of Daniel Boone, Hugh McGary, Thomas Denton
and Richard Hogan. As has been mentioned, the first practising physician
was Dr. Hart, and the first school teacher was Mrs. Coomes, both
Catholics from Maryland.

Col. Matthew Lyon, mentioned elsewhere, is alluded to as the most
remarkable character among the public men of southwestern Kentucky. He
was born in Wicklow county, Ireland, in 1746. His father, for being
engaged in conspiracy against the English government, was tried,
condemned and executed. To secure his passage, Matthew bound himself to
a sea captain to work for twelve months after his arrival in America.
The captain sold him to a Connecticut farmer for two bulls; he served
his time faithfully and became a free man. His favorite by-word was
forever after “By the bulls that bought me.” It is worthy of record that
Rudyard Kipling has put these words in the mouth of one of his recently
created characters, without, however, giving Matthew proper credit. It
is very evident that Colonel Lyon never forgot his father’s execution,
for he was, up to the day of his death, an inveterate hater of the
English government.

After he gained his freedom, he made his home in Vermont. He founded the
town of Fairhaven in 1783, where he built saw and grist-mills, an iron
foundry, engaged in paper making from basswood, and a variety of other
occupations. He served in the Vermont legislature ten years, and for
some time was assistant judge. He served in congress from his adopted
state. He was one of the first arrested under the alien and sedition
laws, was convicted of a libel on the president, John Adams, fined one
thousand dollars, and served a jail sentence in addition.

While in congress, on the thirty-sixth ballot he decided the protracted
seven days’ voting for president by casting his vote and that of Vermont
for Thomas Jefferson, making him president in preference to Aaron Burr.
Shortly after the beginning of the present century he went to Kentucky
with his family. He served in the legislature of his newly adopted
state, and from it, between 1803 and 1811, was in congress eight years.

Eighteen years after his death congress voted to refund with interest
the amount of the fine inflicted on him in 1798. This was done on July
4, 1840. He had a son of the same name who was the father of Gen. H. B.
Lyon. Col. Chittenden Lyon, Matthew’s oldest son, represented his state
in congress eight years, and was fully as impetuous and honest as his
father. Of Matthew Lyon, Gov. John Reynolds, of Illinois, said, “His
Irish impulses were honest, and always on the side of human freedom. His
leading trait of character was his zeal and enthusiasm, almost a madness
itself in any cause he espoused.” This covered his zeal.

The opinion of the members of the first Continental congress, of the
Irish in Ireland, and in the colonies, is well expressed in an address
issued by that body in 1774. In part it said: “Your parliament had done
us no wrong; you had ever been friendly to the rights of mankind, and we
acknowledge with pleasure and gratitude that your nation has produced
patriots who have nobly distinguished themselves in the cause of
humanity and America. Accept our most grateful acknowledgments for the
friendly disposition you have always shown towards us.”

The record made by the men whose names appear in this paper, is evidence
that they were worthy of the tribute paid in this address. What the
feeling was in Ireland, a little more than a year later, was well
described by Gen. Ethan Allen, who said that the people of Cork when
they found he was in the harbor, a prisoner on one of his majesty’s
vessels, sent him a plentiful supply of money, food, and clothing; that
it aroused the ire of Captain Simonds, his keeper, who put an end to the
contributions, saying that “the damned rebels of America should not be
feasted by the damned rebels of Ireland.”

       REV. JAMES CALDWELL, A PATRIOT OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

                 BY JAMES L. O’NEILL, ELIZABETH, N. J.


The territory now occupied by Elizabeth, N. J., was formerly the abode
of savage tribes unknown to fame; whence they came and how long they had
dwelt on these shores are questions that neither authentic history nor
plausible tradition pretends to answer. They have since passed away
without memorial.

It was on Sunday, the 6th day of September, 1609, that the eye of the
stranger from the old world first saw this site. Three days before, a
two-masted schooner called the _Half Moon_, under the command of the
renowned Henry Hudson, cast anchor in Sandy Hook bay. The adventurous
craft was manned by twenty men, Dutch and English, in the service of the
East India Company. Their design was to explore a passage to China and
the Indies by the northwest.

On Sunday, the 6th, John Coleman and four other men were sent out in a
boat to explore the harbor, sailing through the narrows that they found.
The narrow river through which they sailed was the Kills between Bergen
Point and Staten Island and the open sea was Newark bay. The site of the
town that bordered on the bay was, of course, in full view. These five
men are believed to have been the first European discoverers of this
particular spot. Coleman was slain the same day, on his return, by the
treacherous arrow of one of the natives. It is not at all unlikely that
Coleman was an Irishman, as his name bears the Celtic tone, and as there
is nothing to verify it to the contrary.

The most distinguished man of Irish descent who identified himself
completely with this old city was the Rev. James Caldwell, the eighth
pastor of the First Presbyterian church. The Rev. Mr. Caldwell was a
Virginian. His father, John Caldwell, came to this country with four
sisters and his wife and several children, from the County Antrim,
Ireland—what year is unknown to the writer. He settled first at Chestnut
Level, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania.

Soon after, he removed to the new settlements in the southern part of
Virginia and located on Cub creek, a branch of the Staunton river, in
what is now known as Charlotte county. Here in the wilderness, James,
the subject of this sketch, the youngest of seven children, was born in
April, 1734. The place was generally known as the Caldwell Settlement or
Cub Creek. A daughter of one of his brothers, also born here, was the
mother of the Hon. John Caldwell Calhoun of South Carolina, the
well-known senator and leading statesman of the South.

James was prepared for college under Rev. John Todd Caldwell and entered
the College of New Jersey. He came hither when the college was at Newark
and formed the acquaintance, while there, of a young maiden to whom he
was afterwards married. He graduated in September, 1759, and on Sept.
17, 1760, he was ordained. He received a call from the Presbyterian
church of this town in November, 1761, which he accepted. He was duly
installed in March, 1762, with an annual salary of £160. He was at that
time in the twenty-seventh year of his age, a young man of prepossessing
appearance and of more than ordinary promise as a preacher of the
gospel. In the year of 1775 charges were preferred to the Presbytery by
former members of the congregation affecting the orthodoxy of their
pastor, Mr. Caldwell, which, however, were found to be of trivial import
and not affecting at all his soundness in the faith. Whatever uneasiness
may have grown out of this matter, it was speedily forgotten in the rush
of events that preceded and precipitated the War of the Revolution.

On the question then at issue Mr. Caldwell’s position was a matter of
public knowledge. He waited not to learn how the struggle was likely to
terminate; his ardent temperament was for his country, for liberty, for
independence. In all his prayers, often in his sermons and exhortations,
and in all his pastoral intercourse, no religious society in the land
took a bolder move or stand, and few were more efficient for their
country’s cause than Reverend Caldwell and his congregation. And not a
little of this patriotism was owing to the fervent zeal of their pastor.
Among his congregation at the commencement of the Revolution were such
men as William Livingston, governor of the state; Elias Boudinot,
afterwards president of the Continental Congress; Abraham Clark, one of
the signers of the Declaration of Independence; Hon. Robert Ogden,
speaker of the assembly at an earlier day, with his three sons, Robert,
Matthias and Aaron (the two last distinguished officers in the United
States army); Hon. Stephen Crane, speaker of the assembly; Elias Dayton
and his son Jonathan, both of them subsequently general officers of the
army and the latter, speaker of congress. From this one congregation
went forth about forty commissioned officers and privates to fight the
battles for independence.

Among the men belonging to the militia of Elizabeth who enlisted on
board of the different sloops as volunteers, in order to take the ship
_Blue Mountain Valley_, January 22, 1776, under the command of Colonel
Dayton, are to be found the following good old Irish names: Sergeant
Thomas Quigley, Thomas McCarty, Timothy B. Stout, James Clancey, Timothy
Burns, Moses Connell and William Higgins.

Among the commissioned officers of Reverend Caldwell’s congregation in
the army are found a Capt. David Lyons, and Capt. Matthias Lyons, Irish
or of Irish descent, without a doubt.

In April, 1776, Colonel Dayton’s regiment, that had been quartered in
the town during the preceding winter, received orders to march to the
relief of the Northern army then besieging Quebec. As most of the
officers and many of the privates were members of Reverend Caldwell’s
congregation, an ardent desire was expressed for his services as their
chaplain.

Lieutenant Elmer in his diary, April 28, says: “Members of the
Presbyterian meeting set about Reverend Caldwell’s going to Quebec with
us, which was agreed upon after some debate. Drank tea at Colonel
Dayton’s, then went to Major Spencer’s to lodge.” So it was determined
that Reverend Caldwell, whose consent was readily obtained, should
accompany his townsmen on their Northern expedition.

The troops left the town the following day, but Colonel Dayton and
Reverend Caldwell did not join them until Saturday, May 11, at Albany,
N. Y. The Jersey Brigade to which the regiment was attached was
stationed the most of the season in the Mohawk valley. On the 16th of
June Reverend Caldwell was at Johnstown and at German Flats in July,
preaching twice every Sunday and taking an active part in military
operations.

In July, as already related, the British troops had taken possession of
Staten Island. The people of the town became greatly alarmed for their
personal safety, and their relatives in the Northern army became
exceedingly anxious for their friends at home.

Reverend Caldwell returned to his family and people early in the autumn,
where his services were pressingly needed. On the retreat of the
American, and the advance of the British, army the last week of
November, 1776, Reverend Caldwell took his family up into the mountains
and found a home for them in the town of New Providence. From this time
forward Reverend Caldwell was occupied more or less continually in the
service of his country to the close of his life.

The enemy having vacated the town at the end of the first week in
January, he returned to his charge and resumed his ministrations,
mingling the duties of the pastor and the soldier together. At various
times through the long years of the war, during which his congregation
were greatly scattered and their means of subsistence for the most part
considerably diminished, Reverend Caldwell served not only as chaplain
of the Jersey Brigade but as assistant commissary-general from the first
of April, 1777, to April, 1779. Instead of a regular salary, he received
for his pastoral service only what was contributed by the congregation
on Sunday.

His church was burned down on the night of Tuesday, January 25, 1780,
and the services of the congregation were thenceforth held in Colonel
Hatfield’s red storehouse. It is probably while preaching here, or it
may have been at an earlier date, that Reverend Caldwell (as related by
Reverend McDowell) preached with his pistols lying on each side of him
in the pulpit, and the sentinels had to keep watch during time of
service.

The Sunday found him, whether at home or in camp, ready to proclaim the
gospel with its message of mercy and comfort to his fellow men, while he
was ever watchful at other times to improve every opportunity to promote
the spiritual welfare of citizens and soldiers. He was held, therefore,
in the highest esteem by officers and men, confided in by all, and
regarded with enthusiastic love by the rank and file. No one,
consequently, save his parishioner, Governor Livingston, was more feared
and hated by the Tories and the British. Gladly would they have
kidnapped him if they could.

At the fall ejection of 1780 he was chosen by his fellow-citizens a
member of the State Council. He continued in the discharge of his
various duties to which he was called until the autumn of 1781. The last
record made of him by the Presbytery was at their meeting, May 7, 1782.
It is in these words: “The Rev. James Caldwell departed this life,
falling by the hands of a cruel murderer on the twenty-fourth day of
Nov., 1781.” The circumstances attending this mournful event were very
fully announced in the public prints at the time. Rivington of New York,
in his _Gazette_ (a Tory journal of that time), said: “The Rev. Caldwell
was shot dead without any provocation at the Point (now Elizabethport)
by a native of Ireland named Morgan.” Note the sting this allegation
placed to an Irish name.

The _New Jersey Journal_ and the _New Jersey Gazette_ devoted much space
to the murder at the time, but they never mentioned the murderer’s name
nor claimed him to have been Irish. These are the only accounts written
and published at the time. As that of the _New Jersey Gazette_ is the
most particular and was written after sufficient time had been allowed
to obtain by means of the coroner’s inquest, and from other sources, the
exact state of the case, it is apparently the most to be relied upon. It
was generally affirmed at the time that the murderer, as intimated in
the _New Jersey Journal_, was bribed by the British enemy to do the
dreadful deed. And it is not strange that it should have been believed,
as it was known that the British had offered a reward for the
apprehension or assassination of Governor Livingston, and as no other
reason could be assigned for the murder.

The body of Rev. Mr. Caldwell was carried to the public house at the
Point, now Red Jacket Hotel. A homely ambulance was obtained and the
body was slowly brought to town. A crowd of people, greatly excited,
gathered by the way. The mournful cortege, tradition says, passed
through Water street, now Elizabeth avenue, to Broad street; then to
Jersey street; and then to the residence of Mrs. Noll. The day
following, when the people gathered for public worship, the place where
they met might well have been named “Bochim, the Weeping Place.” The
people were crushed under the sad calamity.

The funeral service was held on Tuesday, the 27th, the whole town
suspending all business and gathering in uncontrollable grief at the
house of Mrs. Noll. An opportunity was given to the people to view the
corpse in front of the house in the open street. After all had taken
their last look and before the coffin was closed, Dr. Boudinot came
forward leading nine orphan children, and placing them around the bier
of the parent, made an address of surpassing pathos to the multitude in
their behalf. It was an hour of deep sorrow. The procession then slowly
moved to the grave and laid his body by his wife’s remains. Over his
body was placed a marble slab with the following inscription:

“Sacred to the memory of Rev. James Caldwell and Hannah, his wife, who
fell victims to their country’s cause in the year 1781. He was a zealous
and faithful pastor of the Presbyterian church in this town, where, by
his evangelical labors in the gospel vineyard and his early attachment
to the civil liberty of his country, he has left in the hearts of his
people a better monument than brass or marble. Here also lies the
remains of a woman who exhibited to the world a bright constellation of
female virtues. On that memorable day never to be forgotten, when a
British foe invaded this fair village and fired even the Temple of the
Deity, this peaceful daughter of heaven retired to her hallowed
apartment, imploring heaven for the pardon of the enemy,—in that sacred
moment she was by the bloody hand of a British ruffian despatched, like
her divine Redeemer, through a path of blood to her long wished for
native skies.”




THE IRISH IN SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, ALABAMA, LOUISIANA AND TENNESSEE.

                BY HON. PATRICK WALSH,[24] AUGUSTA, GA.


The time has come when the history of the Irish people in America should
be written. It will be a grand heritage for the Irish-Americans. It will
show how many of their race fought and bled for liberty. This history
will be a priceless gift for future generations. It will be a lasting
memorial of the noble and patriotic work of the element.

It will show how nobly the men of Irish birth and lineage have
illustrated old Ireland under the benign influences of free institutions
and popular government, where liberty is regulated by law, where justice
balances the scales between man and man without regard to race or creed,
giving to every citizen equal advantages and equal opportunities in the
race of life.

A people who have done so much for the honor and glory of this great
republic should feel a just pride in publishing to the world the part
they have taken in the progress of the United States. While there should
be, in the ordinary affairs of life and of government, no discrimination
on account of race or creed, as between citizens of our common country,
each nationality that has borne a prominent part in its history should
seek to perpetuate the record of its people.

In the war between the states Americans of Irish birth or descent stood
for the right as they saw it, and fought for their principles and their
convictions with a patriotic fortitude and heroic valor never surpassed
in ancient or modern times. From the shot at Sumter that was heard
around the world until the Confederate banner was furled forever in
imperishable glory at Appomattox, the Irish and the Irish-Americans of
the North and of the South participated in and confronted each other in
battle array. They fought in the mightiest contest of all the ages, for
their principles and for their altars and their firesides.

I cannot undertake to give in detail the history of the Irish and the
Irish-Americans in South Carolina. It would fill a volume. The Irish
immigration into South Carolina began long since. Of South Carolina
history, they embrace a large part. I find the following in a reprint of
the _Maryland Journal_ of August 20, 1773, for which I am indebted to
Gen. Felix Agnus, proprietor of the _Baltimore American_, which is the
successor of the former:

                                         “PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 11, 1773.

  “Since our last, arrived here the ship Alexander, Captain Hunter,
  with five hundred passengers, and the ship Hannah, Captain Mitchel,
  with five hundred and fifty, both from Londonderry.

  “The ship Walworth, Captain McCausland, sailed from Londonderry for
  South Carolina, about the first of June, with three hundred
  passengers and servants, who were obliged to leave their native
  country, not for their misbehavior, but on account of the great
  distress among the middle and lower class of people.”

Hon. M. P. O’Connor, upon assuming the presidency of the Hibernian
Society of Charleston many years ago, delivered an address in which he
stated that the Hibernian Society of Charleston, S. C., was organized in
1799. “Its first president was the serene and scholarly Rev. Father
Gallagher, who was worthily followed by O’Brien Smith, Simon Magwood,
Samuel Patterson, William A. Caldwell, Thomas Stephens, Henry W. Conner,
the father of Gen. James Conner; James E. Robinson, William Gilliland,
Judge Burke, Governor A. G. Magrath, Bernard O’Neill and M. P. O’Connor.
These men give dignity and character and purpose to the organization.

“Its founders were Thomas A. Malcolm, Edward Courtenay, William and
James Hunter, Joseph Crombie, John S. Adams and a few others. They
professed as the primary object of their union, aid and relief to the
distressed emigrant. But there was latent in their bosoms an object
beyond and higher. It was to preserve the traditions of their
downtrodden race; to embody and cluster around a common centre, in a
genial and hospitable clime, the virtues of their ancestors, and to
reflect in all their splendor under the bright blaze of a Carolina sun
the united rays of true Irish manhood and Irish intelligence.... At the
base of our organization is one grand permeating idea, to give character
and worth and potency to the Irishman in America. It was this society
which built the first Irish-American hall in the United States.”

The gallant and distinguished Gen. M. C. Butler, in response to
inquiries about his family, writes from his home at Edgefield, S. C.:

“I have been absent from home for a fortnight, and did not receive your
letter in regard to the Irish-Americans in our late war from this state
in time to aid you.

“I have a typewritten copy of the family history of the Butlers of my
family, and would send that to you, but it is the only copy, and
therefore do not like to risk it, as it is doubtless too late for your
purpose. The Pierce Butler to whom you refer was of the same stock as my
great-grandfather, James Butler, who came here from Prince Williams
county, Virginia, sometime before the Revolution.

“Another branch moved to Kentucky, to which Gen. Wm. O. Butler belonged
and also Col. E. G. W. Butler of Louisiana. They have always been a
‘fighting’ people—the cropping out of their Irish blood—and have taken a
hand in all the wars of our past history.

“I think the most distinguished and conspicuous military man of my
immediate family was my uncle, Col. Pierce M. Butler, who was killed at
the head of the Palmetto Regiment on the 20th of August, 1847, at
Churubusco, in Mexico. I have always understood he was held in the
highest estimation by General Scott, and other general officers of rank
in the United States army.

“I should think Armstrong, that witty, devil-may-care gallant Irishman
of Charleston, could give you valuable information of the part the
Irish-Americans of this state bore in the Confederate armies. He is
himself a conspicuous example of their gallantry and patriotism.”

I publish the following extracts from letters of Col. James Armstrong,
of Charleston, S. C., just mentioned, than whom there was no more
gallant soldier in the army of Northern Virginia:

“Gen. John Rutledge, of Revolutionary fame, was of Irish descent. So
were the Mannings, three of whom served as governors of the state. Judge
J. Belton O’Neill, Judges Johnstone and Caldwell, James L. Pettigrew,
George McDuffie, Governor Patrick Noble, Gen. John Barnwell, who
defeated the Tuscarora Indians, were of the same race. The Rhetts are
descendants of the renowned ‘Irish Rebel,’ Roger Moore. Judge A. E.
Burke, who fought in 1776, and was afterward judge in South Carolina,
was an Irishman.

“The most prominent South Carolina Irishman in the war of 1812 was, as
you know, Andrew Jackson. In the Mexican war Col. Pierce Butler, who was
killed in command of the famous Palmetto Regiment, was of Irish
extraction. This regiment was in Shields’ Brigade. Patrick Leonard was
color-bearer. Many other Irishmen were in the regiment.

“Charleston had several Irish companies in the Confederate army. Nearly
every company had Irishmen. The flags of the first fourteen regiments,
McGowan’s Brigade, were the first Confederate colors to enter the town
of Gettysburg. The Irish Volunteers was the color company of the First
Regiment and the flag was borne into the town by the captain of the
company, the color-bearer having been shot.

“Capt. John Mitchell, son of the Irish patriot, was in command of Fort
Sumter. He had developed superb courage on the ramparts and was struck
by a shell.

“There were two regiments of South Carolina regulars; about half of the
men were Irish. The middle and up-country regiments contained hundreds
of the descendants of our race.

“Generals Wade Hampton and M. E. Butler have Irish blood. Gen. James
Connor and Gen. Samuel McGowan were of Irish descent. Also Col. Edward
McCrady and Capt. W. H. Ryan and Capt. A. A. Allemong, Capts. M. P.
Parker, James Mulvaney, John C. Mitchell and Sergeant Dominick Spellman,
who was another Sergeant Jasper, were born in Ireland.”

After the rebellion of ’98, in Ireland, a number of Irishmen emigrated
to Georgia. Several families settled in Augusta. The Irish and their
descendants are to be found in all the Southern cities on the coast, and
in the interior from Washington to Galveston.

There were two distinguished lawyers and jurists of Irish birth in
Georgia—Judge John Erskine and Judge O. A. Lochrane. Judge Lochrane was
a wonderfully gifted man. He had great personal magnetism and unusual
powers of brilliant eloquence. He had a handsome person, a noble head
and a pleasing countenance. He had a wonderful memory, the imagination
of a poet and all the graces of oratory. He was called the Irish orator.
With brilliancy and depth and familiarity with the principles of law, he
coped successfully with the ablest lawyers before the highest tribunals.
As chief justice he made a fine reputation. As lawyer, judge and
business man his career was eminently successful. It is with laudable
pride I speak of him as a Georgian and an Irishman.

Judge Erskine was appointed judge of the United States court in Georgia,
in 1865, by President Andrew Johnson. Of him it might well be said his
wisdom enabled him to temper his justice with moderation. Honest
integrity and an inflexible regard for rectitude, and the recognition of
his sterling worth, made him honored even by those who opposed him
politically, and won for him the love and respect of his friends. It may
truly be said, “He never forsook a friend, nor forgot a favor.” After
nearly twenty years of service he retired from the bench in 1883, with
the universal esteem of his associates at the bar. He deservedly
attained a place among the honored roll of Georgia’s worthiest sons.

There was the brilliant and lamented Henry W. Grady, journalist, orator
and patriot, whose grandfather was named O’Grady and whose father died
on the field of battle at the head of his company, fighting for the
Confederacy. The South had no more gifted son. He was proud of his Irish
blood. His untimely death was a public bereavement. His genius and his
talents have won for him a lasting fame.

The Hon. Alexander H. Stephens and the Hon. Joseph E. Brown were two of
the most distinguished sons of Georgia. Mr. Stephens had Irish blood in
his veins and Governor Brown’s ancestors emigrated from the north of
Ireland to South Carolina. These were two of the wisest and greatest of
Georgians. They were proud of their Irish blood and were the life-long
friends of Ireland and the Irish people. They fought intolerance and
proscription and stood boldly for the great principles of civil and
religious liberty.

Irish names are common in the Southern states. In many instances the
people who have them are removed several generations from the
immigrants, thus showing that the Irish immigrant pushed his way into
the South in the early settlement of the country.

A host of Irish-Americans in Georgia during the war were true to the
Confederacy, and fought for its independence. Augusta sent the Irish
Volunteers into the field under Captain Harvey Hull, who was succeeded
by Captain T. G. Barrett. The last captain was M. J. O’Connor. This
company had 100 volunteers. The men fought gallantly in the Army of
Tennessee until the close of the war. Capt. Matt. Rice, a native of
Ireland, commanded the Confederate Light Guards, in the Army of Northern
Virginia. He left a leg at Gettysburg. There were twenty-five Irishmen
in this company. The other companies from Augusta contained Irishmen.
They were in the Clinch Rifles, the Oglethorpes and the Hussars.

There are numbers of Irishmen in Augusta who illustrated Irish valor and
patriotism in the Confederate army. I regret that I have not the space
to mention in detail the names of the Irishmen of Augusta who served the
South during the war.

Hon. A. D. Candler, secretary of state, is proud of his Irish descent.
He writes:

  “Col. Robert McMillan, of the Twenty-fourth Georgia Infantry, went
  from Habersham county and was a gallant officer. He was born in
  Ireland, as was his brother, a gallant private in a company
  commanded by my father, who was himself of Irish lineage.

  “Col. McMillan’s son, Garnett, was born in Elbert county, Georgia,
  but was of pure Irish blood. He was major of his father’s regiment
  and a splendid soldier. He was elected to congress in 1872, but died
  before he took his seat.

  “I am of Irish extraction on both sides, I am proud to say. I I was
  first a private, then a lieutenant and then a captain, and finally a
  colonel in the Confederate army.

  “Captain and afterward Lieutenant-Colonel Neal, of this city, was an
  Irish-American and a good officer, who died in battle. He was a
  brother-in-law of Capt. John Keely, a gallant officer whom you knew.
  At this moment I recall no other officers who were of Irish blood.

  “There were others who were privates in the ranks, and every one
  without exception was a good soldier. Indeed, I have a thousand
  times thought of, and with pride endorsed, the language of the King
  of Poland, who said of the Irish that ‘there is nowhere on the face
  of the earth a people among whom there are so few fools and
  cowards.’”

Captain John Flannery, a native of Ireland, who commanded the Irish
Jasper Greens in the Civil War, writes:

  “Savannah furnished to the Georgia regiment for the Mexican War one
  company of volunteers, something over ninety men, a very large
  majority of them natural-born Irishmen. That company was the Irish
  Jasper Greens, under Captain Henry R. Jackson, who, on being
  promoted, was succeeded by Captain John McMahon, a native-born
  Irishman.

  “In the late war I estimate that Savannah furnished about 1,000 men
  of Irish birth to the armies of the Confederate states. Nearly three
  fourths of these served in distinctively Irish companies, of which
  there were seven. As to their services in the field, that would be
  too long a story, even if I had the data, to write in a letter. The
  Irish element held up their end of the line in every duty that
  devolved upon them on the march, in the battlefield, or elsewhere,
  during the four years of the great struggle.”

Gen. John B. Gordon writes:

  “I had on my staff Major Mitchell, a son of the Irish patriot John
  Mitchell, and who was one of the most gallant soldiers in the
  Confederate army. He had in him the patriotic fire, the ardent love
  of liberty and the devotion to principle which characterized his
  distinguished father. He was desperately wounded in battle, but
  recovered and served to the close. He was always at the post of duty
  and in every particular an ideal soldier.”

Mr. P. J. Moran of Atlanta says:

  “In answer to your question concerning the action of the Irish in
  Atlanta during the war, I have obtained the following facts: The
  priest here at the time was Rev. Father Hassan, a born Irishman. Of
  course he took no immediate part in politics. When the agitation
  came up leading to secession, the Irishmen of Atlanta were almost a
  unit against it, but, after the ordinance was passed, they accepted
  the command of the state. Immediately upon the passage of the
  ordinance the native Georgians appeared on the streets wearing
  cockades; and the _Intelligencer_ appeared next morning with the
  inquiry: ‘What’s the Matter With the Irish That They are not Wearing
  Cockades?’

  “The answer came during the day: ‘We fight; but do not flaunt
  ribbons.’

  “And before the day was over the Jackson Guards, composed of
  eighty-five Irishmen, was organized, made up from the clerks of the
  stores of John Ryan, Meyers and Hayden. They elected as captain,
  William O’Halloran, one of the bravest soldiers that ever lived. His
  deafness interfered with his service, however, and James H. Neal,
  brother of Capt. T. B. Neal, now of Atlanta, was elected to the
  captaincy, with Dennis S. Meyers, John Keely, Peter Fenelon and John
  McGhee as lieutenants. This company went through the war hardly ever
  missing a battle, and when hostilities were concluded, the remnant
  came back home—eleven men out of the eighty-five, who had gone to
  the front. In thus directing the action of the Irish people of
  Atlanta, Father Hassan was prominent. The policy was to be true to
  the Union while it lasted; but when the state spoke—it then became
  their duty to do what they could.”

Gen. Clement A. Evans, one of the best and bravest officers of the
Confederate army, sends the following:

  “It is a pleasure I have in answering your letter to say that I am
  proud of my Irish blood and wish that it may flow on forever. You
  are to take part in an interesting occasion at Nashville designed to
  bring before our American people the value of the generous, brave,
  honorable Irishmen. Your familiarity with our American history will
  serve you well; much of it was made by Irish valor.

  “In our Confederate war the Irish were on both sides, winning
  distinction in both armies—and it is not at all strange that the two
  Irish sides were both right. No other people on earth except the
  Irish can espouse opposite sides and both be right. A brave and true
  Confederate Irishman was captured near Manassas Junction by a
  scouting party of soldiers. He chanced to be dressed in no uniform
  and betrayed by no sign that he belonged to any particular side of
  the pending military issue.

  “The captors demanded of him, ‘Where do you belong? What’s your
  command?’ ‘By me faith,’ said Mike, ‘it’s an ugly question ye are
  asking and I’d be after asking ye by your leave the same thing.’
  ‘Well,’ said the scouts, ‘we are Lincoln’s men.’ ‘All right,’ said
  Mike very warmly, ‘I took ye for gentlemen, an I’m the same.’ But
  the scouts thinking they had caught him, seized him and said, ‘You
  are our prisoner. We belong to Lee’s army.’ ‘Thin ye told me a lie,
  just now, boys, as I thought ye would, and I told ye one meself. Now
  tell me the truth, and I’ll tell ye the truth.’ ‘Well, then, we
  belong to the state of South Carolina.’ ‘So do I,’ quickly and with
  enthusiasm, ‘and I belong to all the other states of the country,
  too; and I bate the whole of you in that one thing. Do you think I
  would come all the way from Ireland to belong to one state when I
  have the right to belong to the whole of them?’ Mike’s Unionism was
  broader than that of nearly all the statesmen of that period.

  “In the beginning of the war the Irish boys who were scattered over
  the South fell in with the companies as they were formed.... One
  company went from my native county, Stewart, electing for its
  captain a young Irishman, Captain Mike Lynch, who made a reputation
  in the 21st Georgia regiment of Dole’s Brigade for skilful courage
  and kindness known throughout the command. Captain Lynch was
  full-blooded Irish, with all the mellow accent of the Emerald Isle.
  I do not think a braver, truer man fought in any army.

  “Captain James Mitchell, son of the Irish exile, served with me
  directly on my staff. He was a brilliant young gentleman, graceful
  in bearing, handsome and of unsurpassed courage. His battle record
  is as good as that of our bravest men. His brother (I think) served
  in Charleston as captain at Fort Sumter. His father was a very
  ardent supporter of secession. Capt. James Mitchell expressed to me,
  at the battle of Fredericksburg, his deep regret that Confederate
  Irishmen were confronted by Meagher’s brave command.

  “There were a considerable number of Irish troops in Louisiana
  regiments. Some of them were under me while I commanded a division
  composed of Georgia, Virginia and Louisiana brigades. There were no
  men ... easier to lead in battle than these Louisiana Irishmen. I
  saw many examples of that superb Irish dash about which I had read
  much in history and romance of European wars.

  “I participated in the late afternoon and evening assault at
  Gettysburg on Lee’s left, when the Irish fighters on the Confederate
  side went to their death with a heroism at which I wondered. You
  have, of course, looked into the history of Meagher’s Irish Brigade.

  “I was in the battle of Fredericksburg on the Confederate left wing,
  and engaged the same day when that brigade was led (at another part
  of the field) to slaughter. I think that there was a cruelty in the
  plan of Federal attack which cannot be excused. If I remember aright
  the splendid brigade was nearly destroyed.

  “Meagher’s Brigade was specially prominent at Gaines’ Mill (or Cold
  Harbor), June 27; at Antietam (Sharpsburg), September 17, and at
  Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862. The United States government has
  never sufficiently recognized the services of that brigade. I wish
  our friend Fleming would have a resolution passed in congress to
  show that appreciation of their valor which has never been accorded.
  I suppose that Burnside’s friends did not want to go too deeply into
  the story of the fearful error which he made.

  “Pat Cleburne is a name which is as lovingly mentioned among us who
  are soldiers as the name of Stonewall Jackson. He was actually loved
  by the army in the West, where he was best known. Cleburne was
  killed in the Confederate assault on the desperately defended
  trenches of the Federals at Franklin, Tenn., November 30, 1864.
  President Davis said: ‘Around Cleburne thickly lay the gallant men
  who in his desperate assault followed him with the implicit
  confidence that in another army was given to Stonewall Jackson, and
  in the one case as in the other, a vacancy was created which could
  never be filled.’

  “I write immediately on reading your letter and on the idea that you
  simply want matters of my own memory. Some investigation would lead
  to a very interesting story of the Irish-Americans in our American
  wars, which I have been sometimes thinking of writing.

  “You will not forget that Father Ryan gave us the sweetest of our
  Southern poetry. I think also that the clergy in both armies should
  not be forgotten in any account of the Confederate struggle.”

Col. C. C. Sanders of Gainesville, colonel of the 24th Georgia, favors
me with a graphic description of the charge of Meagher’s Irish Brigade.
He says:

  “The writer was an eye witness to the charge of the Irish brigade at
  Fredericksburg. General Lee had, at the time, the finest army in
  history. Two formidable lines of battle were protected by a rock
  wall and defended by Cobb’s and Kershaw’s brigades of McLaw’s
  division (one-fourth of whom, I suppose, were Irishmen or of Irish
  extraction), and the famous Washington Artillery. In our immediate
  front one could walk on the dead for hundreds of yards. We were
  pained to see the noble fellows coming up in steady columns to be
  mowed down before our lines of solid flames of fire from our
  entrenched position behind the rock wall and the terrible fire from
  the Washington Artillery on Marie’s Hill, just in our rear and
  commanding every inch of approach.

  “The Irish Brigade would receive our well-directed fire steady and
  firm, and when great gaps were cut through their ranks by the
  artillery, would reform under the incessant fire, come again, sink
  down and rise again, trample the dead and wounded under foot and
  press the stone wall of liquid fire, then recede a few feet and come
  again, like an avalanche into the very jaws of death, until strength
  and endurance failed, having been forced back by shell and the
  deadly miniè ball that no human being could withstand. The field of
  battle ran great streams of blood, and the immortal Irish Brigade
  recoiled before the living wall of fire in glory.

  “I know of no charge upon the field of battle in history to compare
  to the charge of the Irish Brigade at Fredericksburg, unless it was
  Pickett’s Division at Gettysburg, or the Old Guard at Waterloo. The
  immortal Irish Brigade were soldiers indeed. I have heard, but I do
  not know whether it is correct, that after the Fredericksburg battle
  the United States government mustered out the Irish Brigade from
  service and placed all upon the pension roll. You can examine
  records or see for yourself as to its correctness. I have always
  felt proud of my one-fourth Irish blood. The Irish have fought the
  battles of all countries. I wish you success in your address, and
  three cheers for the Immortal Irish Brigade!”

Lieut. Gen. Longstreet says of the charge of Meagher’s Brigade: “The
manner in which Meagher’s Irish Brigade breasted the death storm from
Marie’s Heights of Fredericksburg, was the handsomest thing in the whole
war. Six times in the face of a withering fire, before which whole ranks
were mowed down as corn before the sickle, did the Irish Brigade run up
that hill—rush to inevitable death.”

Said the adjutant-general of Hancock’s staff: “I looked with my field
glasses, and I looked for a long time before I was certain of what I
saw. I at first thought that the men of Meagher’s Brigade had lain down
to allow the shower of shot and shell to pass over them, for they lay in
regular lines. I looked for some movement, some stir—a hand or foot in
motion; but no—they were dead—dead, every man of them.”

The following contribution from Mr. John L. Rapier, of the _Mobile
Register_, is highly appreciated: “When you ask me for the names and
deeds of glory of Irishmen and sons of Irishmen, in peace and war, ’tis
like putting one in the Klondike fields and asking him to pick up the
nuggets of gold that lie round about him. The field of my memory is full
of them. To be brief as possible:

  “Theodore O’Hara, poet, writer, one of the editors of the _Mobile
  Register_, wrote the immortal poem, ‘The Bivouac of the Dead,’
  adopted now by the government. The verses are cast in bronze and cut
  in marble and used in every National cemetery in the country.

  “The ‘Silver-tongued orator of the Chattahoochee,’ Gen. Alpheus
  Baker, of Eufaula, Ala., possibly the most wonderful orator that
  ever lived within the borders of our state.

  “General Finnegan, the hero of Olustee, Fla. I suppose you have him
  on your list already.

  “General O’Neal, ‘Old Tige,’ as the boys called him, after the war,
  governor of Alabama; a great old soldier and statesman.

  “Every company of the Third Alabama had in its ranks a generous
  infusion of Irish blood, and one company, the Emerald Guards, was
  composed entirely of Irishmen. This company lost three captains
  during the war: Captain Loughry, killed at Seven Pines; Captain
  Branigan, killed at Gettysburg; and Captain McGrath, desperately
  wounded at Williamsburg, Second Manassas, the Wilderness and
  Spottsylvania, was brought home to die—perfectly shattered by the
  enemy’s bullets; no hazardous or extra duty performed by the gallant
  Third, but what her Irish members had their full share.

  “The Sixth Alabama had an Irish company, the ‘Montgomery Grays.’
  This company carried to Virginia 103 men. It is declared that but
  eleven of this number returned after the war, and not one of these
  eleven returned unscathed. I am not familiar with the history of the
  Mississippi troops and never met many of the men from that state.

  “Of Louisiana, I recall that Wheat’s Tigers, the First Regiment of
  Louisiana Regulars (Gen. Gladden’s regiment); the First Regiment of
  Louisiana Volunteers and the Fourteenth Regiment Louisiana
  Volunteers were almost entirely composed of Irishmen and the sons of
  Irishmen. Nearly every regiment from that state had a fair
  sprinkling of the same blood. Even the famous Louisiana Zouaves and
  St. Paul’s Chasseurs, generally supposed to be entirely French, were
  more than one-third Irish. It always astonished me to see how
  accurately these Celts could obey an order given in French,
  especially when that order was ‘_En avant_’—i. e., ‘Forward.’ And
  did these gallant battalions furnish heroic soldiers? My dear sir, I
  could write a column on the subject.

  “Shall I pick out one and tell you of him? Then, without effort, I
  select ‘Mike Nolan’—Gen. Mike Nolan. When I was a little boy around
  New Orleans, I used to collect bills for sugar at a small grocery,
  right opposite the Charity hospital in that city. The owner of the
  store was a young, blue-eyed, light-haired Irishman, named Mike
  Nolan. Mild and polite and friendly in his manners; and I am sure it
  is no shame to my foresight that at that time I did not recognize in
  him the to be best, bravest and grandest soldier I ever met.

  “Nolan left New Orleans as a sergeant in one of the companies of the
  First Louisiana Volunteers; he quickly rose to a lieutenancy, then
  captain, lieutenant-colonel and colonel. He commanded his regiment
  with great bravery and ability. He was wounded at Sharpsburg, where
  he assumed command of his brigade upon the death of General Stark,
  who was killed in that battle. General Nolan’s commission as
  brigadier had not reached him when he was killed at Gettysburg.

  “Full, full of glory is the history of the Irishmen and the sons of
  Irishmen in Louisiana, in every branch of life, in the press, in the
  professions, in commerce, in the church and in deeds of valor upon
  the battlefields of Mexico and the South.”

Gen. Wm. B. Bate, the able and distinguished senator from Tennessee, has
furnished me with an important contribution with regard to the loyalty
and gallantry of such Irishmen and Irish-Americans as were connected
with the Confederate army.

To give the military career of such men would require a volume. There
were no more loyal and gallant men in the Confederate army, both as
soldiers and officers, and none was truer to our cause and stood by our
little flag with its stars and bars and cross of St. Andrew, from the
beginning to the ending, with more fidelity, pride and patriotism than
did the Irishmen and Irish-Americans who were enlisted in the
Confederate army.

The Irishman who won the most distinction on the Confederate side and
gained the highest rank was Major-General Patrick R. Cleburne. He was
formerly a private in the English army and when his connection with it
ceased he came to this country and at the time of the breaking out of
the war was a practising lawyer in Helena, Arkansas. He assisted in
raising a regiment of Arkansas troops and became its colonel. His
regiment was united with the Army of Tennessee, was at Bowling Green,
Ky., in General Hardee’s command, under Gen. Albert Sidney Johnson, and
went with it to Shiloh.

General Cleburne commanded a brigade that day composed principally of
Tennesseeans, which fought in Hardee’s corps and which composed the
front line of battle. General Bate’s regiment, the Second Tennessee
Infantry, C. S. A., composed its extreme left. He was from that time on
identified with the Army of Tennessee and its campaigns and battles. He
was subsequently promoted and commanded what is known as Cleburne’s
Division, was an active and efficient factor in the Army of Tennessee
until he was killed in the charge on the Federal breastworks at
Franklin, November 30, 1864.

Next to him in our army was Brigadier-General R. C. Tyler, an Irishman
by birth and an American by adoption. Gen. Tyler was living in Memphis
as a levee contractor when the war broke out and enlisted as a private,
became quartermaster of his regiment, went with it into the battle of
Belmont, its first engagement, and so distinguished himself that it was
but a short time until he was made colonel, and on its consolidation
with the Thirty-seventh he became colonel commanding the consolidation.
The regiment was assigned to General Bate’s original brigade and Tyler
was a part of it as colonel until after the battle of Chickamauga, in
which he again distinguished himself and under the recommendation of
General Bate he was made brigadier-general and put in command of his old
brigade, Bate having been in the meanwhile promoted to a
major-generalship.

General Tyler was wounded at Missionary Ridge and being unfit for field
duty, was assigned to the command at West Point, Ga. He was in command
of the fort there when the surrender of Generals Lee and Johnston’s
armies took place. When General Wilson with his cavalry demanded a
surrender of the fort, Tyler refused to give it up, though with but a
handful of men against thousands, and fell while defiantly fighting
against such odds rather than surrender.

Col. Grace, of the Tenth Tennessee, was an Irishman, a splendid soldier,
and was killed at the head of his regiment at the battle of Jonesboro’,
Ga. Lieutenant-Colonel O’Neil, of the same regiment, a brave soldier,
survived the war but died since. Company E of the Second Tennessee
Regiment was a company composed of Irishmen enlisted by Captain Casper
W. Hunt and served most gallantly throughout the entire war. This
company and the Tenth and Fifteenth regiments were all in Gen. Bate’s
command and composed of Irishmen, and no command made better records
than did they.

Senator Bate says the grandest and greatest Irishman in the Confederacy
was John Mitchell. He who was banished in “Lurid—’48” and condemned to
fourteen years’ imprisonment. He was sent to an English penal colony
from which he subsequently escaped and came to the United States by the
Pacific route and finally settled down near Knoxville, Tenn.

When the war broke out he was editing a paper in Knoxville, and was
appointed an assistant secretary to one of the governmental departments
at Richmond by Jefferson Davis. He had three sons, two of whom were
killed in the armies of the Confederate states and one who still lives
in New York City.

Mitchell was a brilliant writer and author and was imprisoned by the
Federals at Fort Warren at the close of the war. He was finally released
and after a few years returned to Ireland and was elected by the “Bloody
Tips” to the British Parliament, but was denied his seat. He was
reëlected and died during the pendency of his contest for the seat.

Thomas W. Wrenne, president of the Irish-American Centennial
Association, has furnished me with information relative to the troops
Tennessee gave to the Confederate cause and to the Union army:

To the Confederate states Tennessee gave (all volunteers), 108,000.

To the Federal government Tennessee gave (all volunteers), 31,092.

Possibly, excepting North Carolina, Tennessee gave more troops to the
Confederate states in proportion to the population than any other.

It is worthy of note that North Carolina is populated in a great measure
like Tennessee with Irish-American people. You know that most of the
Tennessee early settlers came over from North Carolina and both have
always been patriotic.

You will be agreeably surprised with the number of Irish-Americans among
the great men of Tennessee. Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Davy
Crockett, Sam Houston (I think Andrew Johnson), and General John Adams
were Irish-Americans.

The father and mother of General John Adams came direct from Ireland and
settled in Nashville. Their son was graduated from West Point. When the
last war began he gave his services to the C. S. A. He was a gallant and
brave soldier. His death on horseback on the top of the Federal
breastworks at Franklin was as remarkable a piece of heroism as the war
witnessed.




                   HUGH CARGILL, A FRIEND OF LIBERTY.

                BY THOMAS F. O’MALLEY, SOMERVILLE, MASS.


Hugh Cargill was born in Ballyshannon, Donegal, Ireland, about 1739, and
came to Boston in 1774, “in connection with the British
troops”[25]—probably a soldier in one of the regiments. Concerning his
early life in Boston little is known other than that he soon espoused
the cause of the patriots and left the British service. April 19, 1775,
found him at Concord, Mass., with the Provincial forces. When the enemy
fired the court house and endangered the records, Cargill, with one
Bullock, assisted in removing them to a place of safety.[26]

The events of that day hastened the recruiting of companies and the
formation of regiments. Cargill at once joined Capt. Abishia Brown’s
company which had been raised in the region around Concord and
Lexington. His military experience and training made him a valuable man
in the newly-organized command, and he was at once made a
non-commissioned officer, being the fourth in the list of sergeants of
the company.[27]

Captain Brown’s company was attached to Colonel Nixon’s Middlesex County
regiment and was one of the few companies of that command engaged at
Bunker Hill.

At the conclusion of his service in the army Mr. Cargill settled in
Boston and engaged in the business of a taverner or inn-keeper. In the
first Boston Directory (1789) he is described as a “retailer” with a
place of business on Cambridge street. After many years of close
application to business, and by careful management and economy, he
accumulated considerable money.

In 1790 he purchased from David Hyde the estate in which he carried on
his business.[28] The property consisted of a two-story house on the
westerly side of Cambridge street and bounded southerly on Alden lane.
In 1798 at the time of the levy of the direct tax it was valued at
$3,300.[29]

While in business, Mr. Cargill was active in the affairs of the
community and was especially interested in the local fire companies. On
April 26, 1786, he was proposed to the selectmen, by Capt. Edward
Ridgeway, for membership in his engine company, and “approved.”[30]
Ridgeway’s company was known as No. 6 and was a noted one at that time.
Cargill remained with this company for some years, for as late as 1790
we find his name on the list of members returned to the selectmen.[31]

During the early part of the year 1790 Mr. Cargill retired, and sold his
business to one Smith Coleman, evidently a fellow-countryman. In June,
1790, we find the latter applying for a license to sell spirituous
liquors at the house on Cambridge street “which was licensed last year
under the improvement of Hugh Cargill who is removed.”[32]

After his retirement from business Mr. Cargill spent some years in
Boston, during which he invested in lands in Woburn, Westford, Carlisle
and other surrounding towns.

Early in 1796 he took up his residence in historic Concord. There the
early days of his life on this side of the Atlantic had been spent;
there he saw his first service as an American soldier, and there he was
destined to end his days. In April, 1797, he purchased an extensive
tract of land “near the middle of the town,” known as the Stratton farm,
and made it his home.[33]

On November 27, 1798, he married Rebecca, daughter of Robert Estabrook,
of Concord, the knot being tied by the Rev. Ezra Ripley.[34] Mr.
Cargill’s wedded life was, unfortunately, brief. Within two weeks after
his marriage he was seized with an illness which ended his life on
January 12, 1799.[35]

His will, which is on file in the probate office at Cambridge, Mass.,
bears the date of December 6, 1798, and was witnessed by Jacob Brown,
Obadiah Hall and Paul Adams. The last named married the widow.[36]

By the will his widow was given the “free use and improvement of all the
real estate,” that he should die possessed of, during her natural life
or so long as she remained his widow. Upon her decease or marriage he
gave the Cambridge street estate to Samuel Chamberlain, providing he pay
to Hugh Cargill Maloney, son of Cornelius Maloney of Boston, and Hugh
Cargill Barrett, son of Benjamin Barrett of Carlisle, each the sum of
three hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents. The
remainder of the estate, the will continues:

“I give and bequeath to the inhabitants of the town of Concord and
successors forever the residue of my real estate that I shall dye seized
of in said Commonwealth of Massachusetts; to come into possession of the
same at the decease or marriage of my wife above named and not before
and the income thereof to be solely applied for the support of the poor
of said town of Concord, and my will is that the care of the principal
and income of said estate be under the particular direction of the
selectmen of Concord for the time being; and that the said income be
uniformly and annually delivered by them to the poor of said town to
whom they shall think the proper objects of it; the sale of part of said
estate if thought best by the inhabitants of Concord when they are in
possession and the interest of the money coming by said sale to be
applied as above ordered I am content with: But the farm I give to the
town, called the Stratton farm, lying in the middle of the town of
Concord, I entail the same to be improved as a poor house and the land
to be improved by and for the benefit of the poor; and to be under the
special direction and care of the overseers of the poor of the town of
Concord for the time being for the purposes afore^{sd} for ever.”

His widow, Rebecca Cargill, on December 27, 1800, in anticipation of her
marriage to Paul Adams (which occurred August 2, 1801), executed
releases to the town of all her interest in the estate devised, and thus
vested the gift.[37] The estate is still used as a poor farm.

Mr. Cargill’s remains rest on the westerly slope of the Old Hill burial
ground in Concord, close by the grave of his wife, Rebecca Cargill
Adams, who died March 5, 1838. His grave is marked by a slab surmounted
by an urn in relief, on which is inscribed the initials of his name.
Beneath is the following inscription:[38]

                     Here lyes Intered the remains
                   of Mr. Hugh Cargill late of Boston
                  who died in Concord Jan^ry 12, 1799
                      in the 60th year of his age
            Mr. Cargill was born in Ballyshannon in Ireland
                came into this country in the year 1774
              destitute of the comforts of life but by his
              industry & economy he acquired a good estate
             and having no Children he at his death devis’d
              his estate to his wife Mrs. Rebecca Cargill
             and to a number of his Friends & Relations by
               Marriage & Especially a large and Generous
                  Donation to the Town of Concord for
                  Benevolent and Charitable purposes.

                 How strange O God who reigns on high,
                 That I should come so far to die,
                 And leave my friends where I was bred,
                 To lay my bones with strangers dead
                 But I have hopes when I arise,
                 To dwell with The in yonder skies.

This is the brief story of an humble Irish emigrant. No diarist has
recorded his doings, no writer has extolled his virtues. He lived the
quiet life of the ordinary man and performed his duty faithfully. His
character as pictured in the affairs and acts of his life shows the
man—true and noble-hearted.




                  THE IRISH SETTLERS OF PELHAM, MASS.

                BY MARY LESSEY LINEHAN, HARTFORD, CONN.


Almost every civil war, rebellion, insurrection, and outbreak in
Ireland, from the time of the Tudors downwards, arose more or less
directly from questions connected with the possession of lands. It was
the land question which helped to drive the Presbyterian Irish out, to
become pioneer Irish settlers in America. Whole villages of Irish people
were depopulated.

These clearances gave vast numbers of Irish settlers to America before
the Revolutionary War, and supplied the American army with a body of
brave, determined men. Massachusetts received a very large proportion of
the Irish in the eighteenth century, and being far the most important of
the old colonies, the history of its early settlement is, consequently,
interesting.

One of the most interesting inland settlements in the state of
Massachusetts is the town of Pelham, situated in the northwestern part
of Hampshire county, settled by Irish immigrants in 1738‒9. An
historical spot, as it was the dwelling place of that patriotic soldier,
Daniel Shea, who, after the Revolution, was one of the leaders in
“Shays’ Rebellion.”

In 1738 Robert Peibles, blacksmith, and James Thornton, yeoman, two
Irish immigrants, made a contract with Col. John Stoddard of
Northampton, Mass., for the purchase of his section of “Equivalent
Lands,” with the purpose of establishing thereon a colony of settlers
“who shall be such as were inhabitants of the Kingdom of Ireland or
their descendants.”

This contract having been carried into effect, Colonel Stoddard sold the
land to Robert Peibles, Patrick Peibles, James Thornton, Andrew
McFarland and others named in the deed. These with their families became
the first settlers of Pelham. Among the early settlers are the familiar
Celtic names, McCullough, McCullom, McConkey, Dick, Taylor, Gray,
McClain, Breckenridge, Gilmore, Macklan, McLachay, McNutt, McConnell,
Cochran, Savage, Hamilton, McMullen, McCartney, Joyce, Rankin, White,
McFall, Butler, Felton, Hoar, Griffin, Kelley, McNiell, McLallen,
McClintock.

The new settlement was called New Lisburn, after the town of Lisburn in
the southern part of County Antrim, on the banks of the Lagan, in
Ireland. Some of the settlers coming from Lisburn wished to call their
new home after the mother town, and until 1743 the settlement was called
New Lisburn, when it was changed to Pelham.

At the time of the purchase the condition of the soil was more fertile
than at present. Rye, oats, corn, and barley were raised in abundance,
as well as flax. The hills furnished excellent pasturage for cattle and
horses. The settlers were a quiet, honest, Godfearing people. The town
grew very slowly. In 1776 the population was 729. In 1800, 1,144. Since
the latter date it has decreased in population.

When the trouble arose between England and the colonies, the town of
Pelham was one of the first to answer a communication from the Committee
of Correspondence in Boston. A few literal extracts are interesting:

“To the Committee of Correspondence, Gentlemen: We have considered your
Circular letters and are not a little shoked at the attempts upon the
liberties of America ... we replied back also upon the unhappy Reign of
the Stuart family & bloody Struggles to subdue a free people to
Non-resistance and Passive obedience. We have still a more sense of the
worth of our Liberties by the total loss of them in the conquered
Kingdom of Ireland when altho made of the same one Blood they have a
yoke of Iron put upon their Necks and they must serve their conquerors
with as much of their money and blood as they are pleased to demand and
sustain more intolerable oppressions from these Legislative Masters and
unfeeling Landlords than some of the Barbarious Nations compared by the
Ancient Romans before the wars of their Empire.

“This so grievous a yoke upon the Western Isle which neither they nor
their fathers were able to bear has driven them by hundreds and by
thousands to bide a final adue to their otherwise Dear Native Land and
seek a peaceful Retreat from the bane of Oppressions in this American
Wilderness. Depending upon the faith of the Nation for all the
privileges chartered to American Colonies, we cannot therefore but be
greatly alarmed at the news of the Incroachments upon the Natural and
Chartered Rights of this Province where we have our abode.”

The military history of the town is an honorable one. In the War of the
Revolution a large number of the male residents took part. At the close
of the Revolution the town came into prominence on account of the part
many of its citizens took in “Shays’ Rebellion.” This rebellion was not
prompted by any spirit of disloyalty, nor was it designed or plotted to
overturn the government. It was the wild and lawless expression of
discontent with harsh circumstances, the natural outbreak of those who
were suffering and oppressed.

Daniel Shea, one of the leaders in this rebellion, was a remarkable man.
Very little is known about his early life. His birthplace has been
assigned to Hopkinton, Mass., but this has been disputed. There is a
tradition that his parents and young Shea came from County Cork,
Ireland, and that they lived for some time on the eastern border of
Pelham. He spells his name both “Shea” and “Shays.”

Wherever his birthplace was, one thing is certain concerning him, he
hated England and all things English. Little is known concerning his
life in Pelham previous to the Revolution except what is traditionary.

After the battle of Lexington he was among the first to join a company
of minute men. He was promoted for bravery at the battle of Bunker Hill,
and shared in the campaign resulting in Burgoyne’s surrender. Nothing
shows more clearly the loyal spirit of Daniel Shea than his conduct
during the Revolution. He took a deep interest in a cause which involved
the dearest interests of his country.

Shea returned to Pelham at the close of the war, and in 1781 was chosen
by the town as a member of the Committee of Safety. He was prominent in
other town offices up to the time of the insurrection, and was a
respected citizen. The insurrection is a matter of history and need not
be dwelt on here. Out of the one hundred and fifty men who were
captured, fourteen were tried and sentenced to death, but were
afterwards pardoned. After remaining in hiding for some time, Shea was
pardoned. Having received his pardon, he went to New York state, where
all trace of him is lost.

That Pelham was a distinctively Irish settlement is clearly shown on the
occasion of the settling of the first pastor, Rev. Robert Abercrombie, a
Scotchman. Rev. Mr. Abercrombie was educated at Edinburgh University and
came to this country in 1740 as a licensed preacher. He came to Pelham
in 1742. There arose a division at once in the church. One of the
reasons for the division was the fact of his being a Scotchman and of
his demanding rigid adherence to the doctrines and requirements of the
Church of Scotland.

The majority of the members of the Presbyterian church of Pelham wanted
an Irish Presbyterian clergyman. After a great deal of controversy Mr.
Abercrombie was settled as a pastor. He was unfortunate in having a
strong element of opposition to contend against from his first
connection with the people of Pelham, as shown by the strong protest
against his settlement. After preaching a few years he was compelled to
resign his pastorate.

While the Irish Presbyterians predominated, there were some who were
members of the Church of England and some Roman Catholics. A spirit of
harmony always existed in this community. The people were peaceable,
respecting the rights of others and demanding the same respect in
return.

These early settlers brought with them many of the customs and
traditions of the Emerald Isle, and until after the Revolution they
spoke with a rich Irish brogue. In 1765 many of the settlers, who had
become dissatisfied with the soil and other existing conditions, moved
westward, and joining a colony of settlers from Ballibay, Ireland,
helped to found the town of Salem, N. Y.

Among the descendants of the early settlers who became noted were: Ira
P. Rankin, collector of the port of San Francisco, appointed by
President Lincoln.

Adam Johnson, one of the benefactors of Amherst College, and for whom
the “Johnson Chapel” is named.

Dr. Israel Taylor, a leading physician in Amherst, Mass., until his
death in 1890.

Ithamar Conkey, for a number of years town clerk of Pelham, and in 1830
appointed judge of probate. His son, Ithamar F. Conkey, one of the
leading lawyers of the Massachusetts bar, was a resident of Amherst,
Mass., until his death.

There are very few of the descendants of the original settlers living in
the town of Pelham to-day.




            THOMAS FAWCETT, IRISH QUAKER, AMERICAN PIONEER.

         CONTRIBUTED BY THOMAS PLUNKETT, EAST LIVERPOOL, OHIO.


  The following article possesses sufficient historical interest, I
  think, to merit a place in the JOURNAL of the American-Irish
  Historical Society. The article was evidently written by some one
  well acquainted with the Fawcett family and appeared in the
  _Tribune_ of East Liverpool, Ohio, Aug. 9, 1900. It interested me
  and I thought it might also interest my fellow-members of the
  Society. I therefore send it to you.[39]

There has just been erected and completed a granite memorial monument in
Riverview Cemetery[40] an illustration of which is given below, which is
worthy of mention in the _Tribune_. It will be found to the right of the
main driveway, and about midway in the section which slopes gently to
the south, and faces the city which was founded by Thomas Fawcett about
1800[41] just one hundred years ago. Here, in a beautiful lot, have been
placed the remains of these old pioneers, which were buried in the old
cemetery now going to ruin, and soon to be abandoned. The _Tribune_
takes pleasure in illustrating the memorial and giving the several
inscriptions:

The late James H. Goodwin, a descendant of Abigail Fawcett, daughter of
Thomas Fawcett, had in his possession the oldest record of Thomas
Fawcett’s family. He had special interest in matters historical, and
gathered all the data he could find relating to the Fawcetts and Smiths.
He offered to donate a lot in Riverview cemetery and share the expense
of removing these old pioneers to a place where their remains could
sleep in peace, and rest undisturbed forevermore.

This matter was very dear to his heart, and he contemplated doing just
what has been done, when death claimed him so suddenly the night of
President McKinley’s election in November, 1896. He had in his
possession the original deed granting to Isaac Craig, of Pittsburgh,
Pa., sections Nos. 23 and 24, in range No. 1, township No. 5, bought
December 6, 1796, the deed being dated at Philadelphia, Pa., August 30,
1798, signed by John Adams, president.

Also the deed from Isaac Craig to Thomas Fawcett, conveying the same
sections of land containing 1,090 75‒100 acres for the consideration of
$3,651.00 cash; both deeds are in a good state of preservation, having
been written on parchment.

These relics had been in possession of John Fawcett of Wooster, Ohio,
and at his death fell into the hands of Mrs. Julia Humrickhouse, thence
to her son George, deceased, and through his wife, Mrs. Clara B.
Humrickhouse, to James H. Goodwin.

Thomas Fawcett and his wife, Isabella, were among the earliest settlers
in Chartier’s Valley, Washington county, Pa., and lived there until
about 1795, when they moved to this place, then a part of the Northwest
Territory. His daughter, Abigail Fawcett, married Joseph Smith, father
of the late Wm. G. Smith, and through this union James H. Goodwin,
George S. Goodwin, Henry S. Goodwin, Homer S. Knowles, Mrs. Jno. N.
Taylor, Mrs. Esther Thomas, Mrs. Louisa Anderson, Mrs. Susan Harker, and
all their children, are descended from Thomas Fawcett.

Thomas Fawcett’s eldest son, Joseph, married Esther White, and their
daughter, Elizabeth, married the late George Anderson, on whose farm
Riverview cemetery is located. Of their children four are living—Matthew
Anderson, John Anderson and Miss Lizzie Anderson of this city,[42] and
Joseph Anderson, living in Colorado. The children of Thomas Fawcett
Anderson, deceased, also live with their mother in this city. Mary
Fawcett, another daughter of Joseph and Esther White, married William
Hill, deceased, and two of her children are living here—Mrs. Mary
Hill-Andrews, of Seventh street, and George Hill, on the old farm north
of town.

Julia Fawcett-Humrickhouse was another daughter, and a sister of Mrs.
Anderson and Mrs. Hill. She made her home before her marriage with her
brother John, who married Julia R. Larwell. Miss Rest Humrickhouse,
daughter of Mr. George A. Humrickhouse, this city, is the only living
descendant of this branch of the Fawcett family.

Through Elizabeth Fawcett, who married John Nessly, are descended Mrs.
Matilda Wallace of Hammondsville, Mrs. Judith McCoy of McCoy’s Station,
Jefferson county, and Mrs. Nancy Nessly Winstanley, who was born in
Jefferson county and moved to Cabrey, Ill. Her brother, Rev. John F.
Nessly, is a minister of the Pittsburgh M. E. conference.

EARLY NEW HAMPSHIRE IRISH; SOME PRE-REVOLUTIONARY DENNISES, CORNELIUSES,
                         PATRICKS AND MICHAELS.

                        BY HON. JOHN C. LINEHAN.


Among the Christian names common to the Irish people, especially to
those of the Catholic faith, few were more numerous, a century ago, than
those mentioned in the caption to this article. They were rare among the
Scotch, English, or Welsh. None of them was of Gaelic or old Irish
origin. They came to the ancient Irish with their religion, and, like
their faith, have become nationalized.

According to Lecky, the conquest of Ireland by Cromwell’s soldiers was
not more complete than the conquest of the soldiers by their Irish
wives; their offspring assumed Irish given names, and were brought up in
the faith of their mothers. This was the subject of a complaint against
the Irish government to Henry Cromwell, the son of Oliver. How true this
may have been, it is needless to discuss, but the presence of so many in
New Hampshire before the Revolution bearing the names alluded to, is in
part evidence of the truth of what Lecky wrote, and Prendergast
commented on, for not a few of the surnames are English in appearance.

Darby Field came to New Hampshire in 1631. The date is so remote that no
attempt has thus far been made to denationalize him. Consequently, he
remains on the records as a plain “Irish soldier for discovery.” His
home was in Exeter. He is credited with being the first in the English
settlements to discover the White Mountains. That he was a useful
citizen is evident from the provincial papers. How many American Fields
are descended from him cannot be determined, but if there are any, there
isn’t much doubt that they will locate the birthplace of their ancestor
in Ulster. This fad extends even to some children of the modern Irish.
The illustrious “Tim” Campbell, ex-member of congress from New York, has
been classified as of “Scotch-Irish” descent, and recently a young man
named Quinn, of the first generation born here, said, “His father was a
Scotch-Irishman from Kilkenny, in the north of Ireland.” A little rough
on the city paved with marble, but such is fad.

A good, sturdy representative of the Fields to-day in New Hampshire, as
Irish in blood as Darby Field was, is the Hon. John H. Field, who was a
member of the state senate in 1899‒1900. His home is Nashua. He is of
the faith of his fathers.

Darby Kelly was the ancestor of many American Kellys. His descendants
are almost innumerable. Like Darby Field, he, too, was a soldier, as
well as a schoolmaster and farmer. Gen. Benjamin F. Kelly, of West
Virginia, was his grandson; the latter acquired distinction in the Civil
War. The name Darby Kelly appears on the muster rolls of company and
regiment from 1748 to the fall of Wolfe and Montcalm.

Of the Patricks, Patrick O’Flynn possessed a military record his
offspring may well take pride in. His name appears quite often in the
short wars preceding the struggle for independence. He represented the
town of Bedford at Bunker Hill and served through the long war which
ended at Yorktown. At its close he went West, dying in Illinois. His
name appears on the United States pension rolls for 1825, with his
company and regiment.

Another was Patrick Cogan. He was quartermaster of the First New
Hampshire regiment, serving in that capacity under Stark, Cilley and
Reid. He died in the service in 1778. His regiment was in Sullivan’s
brigade at Ticonderoga in 1777. He represented Sullivan’s town, Durham.
Stephen Cogan, possibly a relative, was a selectman in the same town in
1780, and with him were Joseph, William and Joseph Cogan, Jr.

A namesake, if not a relative of Darby Field, was Patrick Field, a
soldier in the Continental army. Patrick Guinlan was teaching school in
Concord before 1770. He is given mention in Bouton’s history of that
place.

A well-known town in the south of Ireland is Dungarvan, and a well-known
locality in Concord is “Garvin’s Falls,” just south of the city, on the
Merrimack. The falls are named for Patrick Garvin, one of the first
settlers. His name appears frequently as one of the defenders of the
garrison against the Indians.

New Hampshire furnished to Iowa one of her most distinguished sons, in
the person of the Hon. James W. Grimes, who acquired a national
reputation during the Civil War. One of the first, if not the very
first, of that name in New Hampshire was Patrick Grimes.

Patrick Gault was the ancestor of some of New Hampshire’s substantial
citizens. His name appears early in the provincial papers. As much can
be said of Patrick Taggart and his descendants.

Patrick White was the first of his line in the old Granite state. He
came to Peterborough before 1740. Gen. Daniel M. White, commander of the
New Hampshire National Guard in 1894, was one of his descendants.

Patrick Orr is a reminder of the slogan of 1798, “Remember William Orr.”
Many useful citizens of the Granite state bear this name. It is not now
so common as it was fifty or seventy-five years ago. John Orr served
seven terms in the state senate, his legislative career ending in 1804.

Patrick Griffin represented a name as common here now as it is in
Ireland. Simon G. Griffin, brevet major-general, was a New Hampshire
soldier with a fine record in the Civil War.

Cornelius Connor represented a name famous in Ireland’s annals and
familiar to the readers of New Hampshire state and provincial papers.

It is first mentioned in 1710. The occasion was the payment of a bill
presented by him for moccasins, so it is fair to presume he was a
shoemaker. The name Connor, or Conner, has been well known in the town
of Exeter for nearly 200 years. An Exeter man, possibly a descendant of
Cornelius, was Col. Freeman Conner, who commanded the Forty-fourth New
York regiment in the Civil War. He was also assistant postmaster of
Chicago under the late James A. Sexton, during the administration of
President Benjamin Harrison. J. M. Connor, of Hopkinton, is one of the
prominent grangers in New Hampshire, and an authority on agricultural
matters.

James O’Conner, a native of Ireland, and a surgeon in the Continental
army, was among the first settlers in the town of Sanbornton. One of his
descendants went to the East Indies and was traffic manager of the
Ganges canal in 1869. Cornelius Connor is the first of the name to
appear on the provincial records. The family has been prolific—for the
Connors are numerous—and is looked upon now as a distinctive New
Hampshire name.

Another of the “Cons” was Cornelius Driscoll. His name appears first in
1715, attached to a petition praying for the settlement of a minister in
Dover. The name is spelled Drisco, but there is no question about it
being Driscoll, for two reasons: first, the given name Cornelius, as
well as there also being a Teage Driscoll; “Tim” is the English of
Teage; and second, the word Bristol is spelled Bristo. The name is still
spelled Drisco by people bearing it. Later it appears spelled properly,
“Driscoll,” in the state papers, but an interrogation mark is placed
after the name, which is evidence of the mutilation of Irish names by
those not conversant with their character. Teage Drisco’s name appears
on the records of the town of Exeter in 1664, Cornelius Driscoe in 1725,
and John Drisco in 1710. “Driscoll Hill,” in Francestown, is a locality
spoken of in the _Granite Monthly_ for August, 1897. Cornelius Drisco
was one of the proprietors of the town of Gilmanton in 1727. Still
another “Con,” who appears often in the records, is Cornelius Lary. He
was in Exeter as early as 1674. Like other old Irish surnames, it was
twisted out of shape by the English scribes, so that in various places
it is spelled O’Leary, Lary, and Lear.

As is well-known, this is one of the great south of Ireland names. It
would be of great interest to “Con’s” countrymen had he kept a diary
relating his experience in those days. “The Curse of Crummill” was on
the lips of many at that time, perhaps on his. Thirty-six years later,
in 1710, the names of Daniel, Samuel, Thomas, and Cornelius Lary appear,
perhaps the sons of the emigrant. It is still common in Maine as well as
in New Hampshire as Lary. Col. Tobias Lear, of Portsmouth, was
Washington’s secretary. Whether his name was Leary originally, cannot be
determined. He married a daughter of Col. Pierse Long. The latter was
the son of Pierse Long who came to Portsmouth from Limerick, Ireland.
Colonel Long was with Sullivan at the capture of Newcastle, and
commanded a regiment in the Continental army.

McDuffee has been a well-known New Hampshire family name for one hundred
and fifty years. Col. John McDuffee commanded a regiment in the
Continental army and some of the most substantial business men in the
state are of the same clan. The “Cons” were also represented in this
family in the person of Cornelius Duffee, whose name appears in the
index of the provincial papers.

Of the Michaels, the most distinguished was Gen. Michael McClary. He was
the grandson of Andrew McClary, who came over in 1726, to Epsom, and the
nephew of Maj. Andrew McClary, who fell at Bunker Hill, and of Lieut.
John McClary, who was killed in action at Saratoga. He was an ensign at
Bunker Hill, and was appointed captain in the Continental army later. He
filled many positions in civil life. He was the first adjutant-general
of New Hampshire under the new constitution, and also served as United
States marshal. The family was prominent in state affairs. John McClary
was a member of the governor’s council five years before 1785, and of
the senate six years. Michael McClary served in the senate twelve years,
and James H. McClary, two years; Michael was elected, but resigned, and
James H. was chosen in convention to fill the vacancy.

The original emigrant, Andrew, came over on the same vessel with James
Harney. Their friendship was carried down to the third generation in the
name of James Harney McClary. There were others of the same name in the
state, but not of the same family. Whether as Cleary, Clary, or
Clery—with or without the Mac or the O—the name is as Irish as the
shamrock.

Another of the Michaels who, if not as distinguished as the one
mentioned, was a useful citizen, was Michael Dwyer, who was one of the
first settlers of Holderness, N. H. His name appears frequently in the
state records; he was selectman of his town, and represented it in the
state legislature, and it is evident that he was prominent in business
and political affairs in his section of the state.

A contemporary of his in Holderness was Capt. Bryan McSweeny, a veteran
of the old French, Indian, and Revolutionary wars.

Others of the name of Dwyer were in New Hampshire before Michael’s day,
for the name of Edward Dwyer appears on the Exeter town records in 1695,
also that of James Dwyer. Time has probably changed the name to Dyer.

Michael Johnston was one of the first two settlers of Haverhill, N. H.,
going there from Haverhill, Mass. His brother, Col. Charles Johnston, in
point of character, it is written, was the most prominent of Haverhill’s
first settlers. He also had a son Michael. Whether Irish or Scottish,
Johnston is the English for McShane or McIan.

The name Carroll, borne by Maryland’s “first citizen,” was represented
among the New Hampshire Michaels, in the person of Michael Carroll. A
county also bears his name, and it is quite common in New Hampshire. The
New Hampshire national bank examiner is the Hon. E. H. Carroll, and the
labor commissioner is Col. L. H. Carroll. A brother of the bank
commissioner is superintendent of schools in Worcester, Mass.

Michael Annis, perhaps Ennis, bore the name of the man who built the
first house in the town of Warner. His father came from Enniskillen “in
Great Britain,” so the history reads, but Ireland would be more correct
geographically. Adding the Mac and spelling the name properly it would
be McGuinis, McInnis, McGinnis, McGuinness, or Magenis.

Michael Chatterton was the first of the Michaels to appear on the New
Hampshire records. He was one of the servants sent over by Capt. John
Mason, coming at the same time as Darby Field, between 1631 and 1640.
With him was William Dermit. Albee, the historian of Newcastle, wrote
that Portsmouth’s first settlers were Celts from Devon and Cornwall.
There was more or less trade between the colony in its early days and
Limerick and Kilkenny, Ireland, Kilkenny rugs and Limerick bacon being
spoken of.

Michael Clark represented another widely known New Hampshire family
name, well represented at the bar, on the bench, and in the upper and
lower branches of congress.

Michael Fitzgerald was one of the great Norman Irish clan which in time
became more Irish than the Irish themselves. Edward Fitzgerald, one of
the first settlers of Boscawen, was reputed to be well educated and
prosperous. Col. John Fitzgerald was Washington’s favorite aid.

As a rule, the New Hampshire descendants of the Fitzgeralds have divided
the name. Some are known as Fitzes, others as Geralds.

Michael Kelly was a grandson of Darby Kelly mentioned, and the brother
of Gen. B. F. Kelly, of West Virginia, as well as the father of ex-Mayor
F. H. Kelly, of Worcester, and of Capt. Warren Michael Kelly, of
Donohoe’s Tenth N. H. regiment in the Civil War.

Michael Lyons was a namesake of the impulsive Matthew Lyons, of Vermont
and Kentucky (who thanked God, when in congress, that he was not one of
“Cromwell’s bastards”), and also of Gen. Nathaniel Lyons, one of the
gallant soldiers and martyrs of the Civil War.

Michael Metcalf bore the same surname as the only Knownothing
governor-elect of New Hampshire. The latter, maternally, was sprung from
a respectable Irish family named Montague, so the historian of the town
of Newport wrote, which perhaps accounts for the appearance of Michael
among the Metcalfs; and here was also a Michael Metcalf, Jr., which
showed that it took one generation to make the name unpopular.

Michael Smith bore a numerous family surname not confined to any one of
the British Isles, but common to all. He was in New Hampshire early, and
with him was Patrick Smith. No doubt both were Irish.

Michael Butler represented another great Irish family, whose most
distinguished member, produced in New Hampshire, was Gen. Benjamin F.
Butler. About the first to appear in the colony was John Butler, who was
in Dover in 1647. James Butler was in Woburn, Mass., in or before 1676;
his son, John Butler, came to Pelham, N. H., in 1721. They are the
ancestors of many of the name in the state.

The foregoing sketches have been written in order to show the kind of
men some of those New Hampshire Dennises, Corneliuses, Patricks and
Michaels were. A modern Irishman, bearing any of these names, would
never have his nationality questioned. All are appended here so as to
have them placed on record as another piece of evidence to illustrate
the presence of Irish in New Hampshire before the Revolution.

      MATTHEW WATSON, AN IRISH SETTLER OF BARRINGTON, R. I., 1722.

                       BY THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY.


The town of Barrington is picturesquely located in eastern Rhode Island.
It has a fine outlook on Narragansett bay and also borders on the
Warren[43] river. It was incorporated by Massachusetts in 1718. In
1746‒’47 the territory came under the jurisdiction of Rhode Island, and
Barrington was merged with Warren. In 1770 Warren was divided and
Barrington again incorporated, this time by Rhode Island. There are
several historic sites in the town, many pleasant drives and a number of
interesting caves, woods and districts. The present population is
between 1600 and 1700.

One of the earliest Irish settlers in Barrington[44] was Matthew Watson.
He located there[45] over 175 years ago and reminiscences of his life
and times are still current among the people. Matthew was born in
Ireland in 1696. His people are believed to have been Presbyterians, an
element that has given many sturdy patriots to the cause of Irish
nationality.[46] The family left Ireland for America about 1712. They
landed in Boston.

What induced them to leave the old country can only be conjectured. It
is reasonable to suppose, however, that it was due to causes that
compelled thousands of other Irish Presbyterians to emigrate. These
causes were the result of English oppression. The Irish Presbyterians
were treated with great harshness[47] by various successive governments
in England. At one time edicts of banishment were issued against their
ministers; at another we find the government wickedly declaring their
pulpits vacant and filling them with clergymen of the Established
church. When England had a policy of church or state to carry out in
Ireland it could be made to bear heavily on the Presbyterian as on the
Catholic. England’s repeated suppression of Irish industries also caused
great numbers of Presbyterians and Irish Protestants, generally, to
emigrate to America.

The Watson family here mentioned consisted of Matthew, his father and
mother, four brothers and one sister. Sometime after arriving in Boston
the family removed to Leicester, Mass. Matthew came to Barrington in
1722, being then in his 26th year. He entered the employ of John Read, a
brickmaker, and rapidly attained great proficiency in the business,
winning the confidence of his employer and the esteem of his associates.
In the course of time he fell in love with his employer’s daughter,
Bethiah. His affection was reciprocated and the two soon became engaged.
The fact becoming known, Bethiah’s father earnestly opposed it. She was
his only daughter, and he eloquently represented to her the “folly” of
throwing herself away on “a little poor Irishman.” His arguments were of
no avail, however, and she and Matthew were married at Barrington in
1732.

It was a happy marriage and her father lived to bless the day when the
“little poor Irishman” became his daughter’s husband. Subsequently
Matthew purchased the farm of his father-in-law and conducted the
brick-making business on an extensive scale. He erected a commodious
brick mansion house which became known to the country round about as the
“Great Watson Mansion,” embellished the grounds and amassed a fortune of
$80,000.[48]

By some it is held that Matthew’s father had also located in Barrington.
The original Watson property comprised a very large part of the town.
The homestead has since been greatly reduced, however, by dividing it
among the children, by bequests and by extensive sales to new-comers.
The estate at present comprises about fifty acres, tillable and
woodland, held by descendants of Matthew. The land is very productive.
There is one six-acre lot, nearly as level as a floor, and which
produces rich crops of hay, although it has not been dressed in the past
thirty years.[49] Underneath the greater part of the estate is a stratum
of the best quality of blue clay within four to six feet of the surface.

This stratum underlies nearly the entire town, cropping out on the bay
and river shores. The principal industry of Barrington is brick-making,
which has been carried on for an indefinite period. At present
30,000,000 are produced annually. The labor in the old brick-yards of
the Watson family was done chiefly by slaves of whom Watson owned nearly
fifty. All these he manumitted some time before his death. The
continuous transportation of brick to the bay, by these slaves, for
shipment gradually wore a roadway more than six feet in depth.[50] By
plowing and cultivation this has long since been mostly filled in,
though there are still places where the old roadway shows two or three
feet deep. Some time in the eighteenth century a law was passed
ordaining that bricks should be made of certain specified dimensions.
Matthew Watson, the settler, considered this requirement as very unjust,
and so decided not to change the size of his product. In order to escape
prosecution, however, he ceased calling his goods brick, but instead
styled them “Watson’s ware.” As there was no law regarding “Watson’s
ware” the plan succeeded, and the old gentleman continued making and
selling brick at their former dimensions.[51] The “Great Watson Mansion”
was for a long period visited by people who had heard of its dimensions
and sumptuous furnishings and who desired to feast their eyes upon so
much grandeur.

It is said to have possessed some of the earliest wall paper used in
America, outside of Boston. The jambs, mantels and hearth were
constructed of marble and imported from Amsterdam. The carpet was made
from the wool of sheep raised on the farm, and being the first carpet
used in those parts attracted visitors from points even forty miles
away. A part of the mansion was recently still standing, and occupied by
descendants of Matthew. The present is the sixth American generation of
the family. Matthew, born in 1696, died in 1807; having completed 110
years of life and started on his 111th.

It is said that up to the day of his death, his faculties were
unimpaired, except for blindness. On the day that he was 100 years old
he called for his saddle-horse, mounted without assistance and rode off
briskly for a couple of miles. Upon his return, the negro servant being
absent, and the great gate unopened, he touched up his horse and cleared
it at a bound.

Further interesting facts regarding Matthew Watson are found in an
article published[52] some years before his death. It was written at
Barrington and reads as follows:

“There is now living in this town Matthew Watson, Esq., in the 105th
year of his age, in a pretty good state of health, and in the enjoyment
of his faculties, except being blind. He was born in Coleraine in the
province of Ulster, in the north of Ireland, in March, A. D. 1696, from
whence he, with his father and mother, four brothers and one sister,
migrated and arrived at Boston, A. D. 1712, from whence they removed to
and settled in Leicester, in the county of Worcester (Mass.), where he
hath one brother, Deacon Oliver Watson, now living. Mr. Watson came to
this town A. D. 1722, where by his industry he acquired a pretty
handsome fortune. He hath sustained the office of a Justice of the Peace
in the town, and was formerly a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for
the county of Bristol. He hath been a member of the Congregational
church in this town between seventy and eighty years without censure. He
hath ten children now living, the youngest of whom is fifty-three years
of age, all in a married state, except his eldest and youngest
daughters, who are widows. He was born in the seventeenth, lived through
the eighteenth and is now progressing in the nineteenth century.”

The foregoing extract was found, in 1893, by the writer while engaged in
examining files of the _Providence Gazette_ at the rooms of the Rhode
Island Historical Society in Providence. As the article was written at
Barrington during the lifetime of the centenarian, some, at least, of
the facts were probably obtained from his own lips. The extract may
therefore be considered as authoritatively settling certain data which
have long been in dispute.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Matthew is said to have had fifteen children, ten of whom were living at
the time of his decease.[53] The names of these ten were Abigail, Mary,
Rachel, Mercy, Bethiah, Matthew, Lydia, William, John and Samuel. There
were also many grandchildren and great grandchildren. In Arnold’s “Vital
Record of Rhode Island” appears an entry under Barrington which states
in substance that “Robert Watson and Mary Orr married at Londonderry,
Ireland, 1695.” They were probably the parents of Matthew, the
Barrington settler, who had the names recorded for purpose of reference;
or they may have been so recorded by some other member of the family.
The centenarian was twice married.[54] Bethia, his first wife, died in
1778, leaving ten children. One of Matthew’s descendants, John Watson,
married Ann Waterman, daughter of Capt. Asa Waterman, of Rhode Island,
who was assistant commissary-general during the Revolution. She was
related to Governor Cooke of Rhode Island.

Among the centenarian’s descendants were the following: Robert S. W.
Watson who wedded Patience Blygh. He was born in 1804; Annie Cooke
Watson, born in 1831; Dr. S. T. Watson, born 1832; John W. Watson, 1835;
Mary H. Watson, 1837; Henry H. Watson, 1839; Robert S. Watson, 1843;
Emily F. Watson, 1845; Robert S. Watson, 1846; Charlotte A. Watson,
1850.

Nearly every generation of the family has had a Matthew in it. A second
Matthew Watson was born in 1741.[55] A Matthew Watson of a later
generation married Abby B. Wheaton, of Providence, in 1818. The
Providence Directory for 1844 shows “Matthew Watson, manufacturer, rear
Roger Williams Bank,” and gives his residence as Angell street. In
February, 1892, the following interesting communication appeared in the
Providence _Journal_. Its author is thought to have been Matthew Watson,
of Providence, a recent representative of the name.

                  *       *       *       *       *

THE CUP THAT CHEERS. To the Editor of the _Journal_: The first time that
tea was brought to Barrington, Rhode Island, is not known to the writer
of this article, but the second time it was brought by Matthew Watson
something over a hundred and fifty years ago, before the famous Boston
tea party.

Matthew Watson sold brick which he manufactured from the clay on his own
property, which was extensive, even for those days, in Newport. On one
of his trips there he bought the teapot, a sketch of which appears with
this article, and six teacups.

As tea had never been used, of course there was no tea-kettle, and water
to make this was boiled in a dinner pot hanging from a crane over the
wood fire. The teapot now is in possession of one of Matthew Watson’s
descendants, and is a quaint little affair of some ancient style of
crockery. It stands on three legs, which adds to its unique appearance.

Once it was broken into eight pieces, but was so cleverly mended that it
is almost impossible to detect this as it stands, with other heirlooms,
looking down on the china and glass of later dates.

                                                      FAIRLEIGH COTTAGE.




   THE FIELD, SCOPE AND OPPORTUNITY OF THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL
                                SOCIETY.

            BY DENNIS HARVEY SHEAHAN,[56] PROVIDENCE, R. I.


The history of a country is dear to the heart of the lover of that
country. By the aid of historical study we learn of the origin, growth
and development of a race of people; their customs, religions, laws,
governments; their accomplishments and what they have contributed to the
economy of the world.

The historian points out the past to the present and future. He puts
aside the veil that has gathered about the dim past, opens up to the
gaze of the bright present the panorama of human achievement, and blazes
the way for his successor in the rosy future.

What the clergyman learns from the theological disputations of the past,
the poring monk has gathered together; what the physician now acquires
with comparative ease is furnished him by the knowledge garnered from
the experience of his brethren from the time when man learned that pain
and aches affected his being; what the lawyer gains from precedents is a
guiding light which sheds its rays upon problems of jurisprudence that
the legal lore of the past generations has taken from the leaves of
experience; what formulæ the scientist is able to demonstrate, he owes
to the observations of men who, through the ages, have chronicled the
phenomena of nature; the statesman is able to meet the crisis of the
present by being informed as to other crises in governmental affairs.

The citizen of a republic who neglects to learn the fundamental
principles upon which rest the laws of the land; who does not know how
the country was developed and maintained is as a blind man and not able
to bring to the exercise of his suffrage the amount of intelligence that
the country has a right to require from him.

This obligation comes to us in a twofold capacity. We, as citizens of
this great republic, should study the history of our country from a
patriotic standpoint, while as Irishmen, or descendants of Irishmen, it
should be not only a duty, but a pleasure, to learn of the deeds of the
Irish in America.

Therefore, an organization such as the American-Irish Historical
Society, if it had no other _raison d’être_, would accomplish a
patriotic purpose if it served only as an incentive to the study of the
deeds of Irishmen and their descendants in America. It has become almost
a maxim in historical matters, that the history of events cannot be
accepted as facts until the generation which lived at the time said
events occurred has passed away.

The passions, influences and conditions which generate, shape and
control events, lend a coloring to their recital, which deep-hued or
faint as painted by the writer at the time, are toned down or made
stronger by the historian of a future generation, who, unmindful of
passions, influences or conditions, and with an eye single to the
preservation of history by means of the truth, makes past occurrences
stand out in their true light.

Deeds that have received but a passing mention from writers whose minds
were biased, are rescued from an unmerited insignificance, and placed
high in the Temple of Fame; while highly extolled acts, given undue
prominence by a partisan writer, are consigned to a merited oblivion by
the historian of a later but more impartial epoch.

A member of the Society of Friends who desires to familiarize himself
with the history of his sect in New England, would find but little of
the truth in the writings which have come from such intellectual
dyspeptics as Cotton Mather and his disciples. But, in the unwritten
history of Quaker persecutions that have become legendary, by the purity
of their lives, by their nobility of character and their Christianizing
influences, the pioneers of that faith stand out in bold relief in the
religious history of Puritan New England, with its dark background of
scourging, mutilation, banishments and hangings.

By analogy, how can the Irish-American race expect that the history of
Irishmen in New England can be presented in just proportion to the true
merits of the case? As in New England, so throughout the colonies. The
Virginia Cavalier was not less hostile to the Irish than the
Massachusetts Puritan.

Should the American-Irish Historical Society go out of existence
to-morrow, it would have already accomplished a grand mission in this:
that it has brought forth from obscure records the deeds of Irishmen in
America, and has laid the foundation for the erection of an historical
monument to Irishmen, that, with its base laid in colonial times, and
still being constructed, challenges the respect and admiration of all
lovers of American history.

The work of this society has been thus far largely confined to research
of New England records. This research has been fruitful of good results.
Among other things we learn of the Irish as brickmakers at Rehobeth,
Mass., and as settlers in Salem and Lynn in early colonial times.

Again, we learn that the Irish in the Granite state had become so
numerous in colonial times that the general court of Massachusetts
passed a law prohibiting the “wild Irishmen of New Hampshire” from
coming across the state line, lest they should drive out the people of
the older colony. As long as that state shall last the glory and the
fame of the Sullivans and their contemporaries of the Irish race will
remain illustrious.

This research has extracted from the records of Rhode Island the
influence of the Irish schoolmaster, MacSparran, in moulding the
intellectual development of that colony; it has called attention to the
work of George Berkeley in the promotion of education here, and what is
to me personally exceedingly pleasant information, that Brown
University, my beloved alma mater, in its infancy was succored by the
contributions of worthy people residing in Ireland.

The work of presenting to the world the achievements of the Irish in
America, in its just proportion to the achievements of men of other
races in the colonization, struggle for independence, and the creation
of a republic, the development of that republic from a theory into a
concrete nation, and the perpetuation of that nation, is a duty not only
to the men whose deeds are to be chronicled, but also a debt which we
owe to ourselves, which we should cheerfully assume. The labor involved
in this from its very nature is such as can only be performed by an
organization such as the American-Irish Historical Society.

The true status of the Irish in America, notwithstanding the fact that
their brain and brawn have been interwoven in the woof and web of our
nation’s fabric, has never been fully appreciated by reason of the
prejudices which have been associated with anything that bore an Irish
name. This prejudice, in no small part, arose from misconception and
misunderstanding of the Irish nature, temperament, and characteristics.
There is a brand of bigotry that is sometimes designated as inborn. In
the case of a bigot whose bigotry is congenital, it is well to follow
the Scriptural injunction to reason not with a fool lest he grow wise.

But in the case of those persons who, by reason of misconception, or
want of acquaintance with Irishmen, cannot properly estimate our race,
yet whose minds are broad enough to cherish the worth of a man when
demonstrated, and whose patriotism counts every man a friend who has
contributed to the glory of his country, an impartial history of the
deeds of Irishmen in America would effectively serve to displace any
prejudice.

What lover of the human race, animated by that noble sentiment of
Terrence, “I am a man, and I think nothing human foreign to me,” can
fail to appreciate the sturdy virtues of the Irish people in America,
their patient industry, their obedience to constituted authority, their
domestic constancy, their desire to provide homes for their families,
and education for their children.

What patriotic American can fail to be moved by emotions of gratitude
when he learns among other facts that the Irish in Ireland assisted with
food and provisions the struggling settlers of Boston in a time of dire
distress; that Irishmen of Philadelphia contributed large sums of money
to the famished Revolutionary heroes at Valley Forge; that George
Washington considered himself honored in being elected a member of an
Irish society; that nine of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence were men of Irish blood; that on the field of war, and in
the council chamber of the nation, as well as in the administration of
national, state, and municipal affairs, from the time of our earliest
history to the present time, men of that race have given their lives and
property to the nation’s cause. The work of this society thus far in
this direction gives promise of either destroying the prejudices that
have hitherto existed against the Irish people, or removing the venom
from the fangs of bigotry.

To my mind the most urgent need of a society of this nature is the means
it affords of preserving Irish history in America. It would be a great
misfortune if the history of the Irish people in America, at present
fragmentary at best, yet gathered together under favorable conditions
and after the most careful and painstaking labor, could not find some
secure lodgment.

What more suitable abiding place than the cabinet of the American-Irish
Historical Society, from whence it could find its way into the private
and public libraries, not only of our own country, but of the civilized
world?

This Society, in the short time it has been in existence, has
accomplished so much in its chosen field as already to have demonstrated
quite clearly its scope. From the publications issued by its members,
notably the work of Secretary-General Murray in Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, Commissioner Linehan in New Hampshire, Senator Walsh in Georgia,
Hon. Joseph T. Lawless in Virginia, and others, our Society has already
contributed a fund of rich historical value to the history of this
country. It would suffice to cite this labor to show the scope.

The thought has occurred to me that it might be well, however, to
suggest a specialization of this work, and to provide avenues for its
dissemination. The Society should pursue the line of procedure already
mapped out by extending its membership to every state in the country.
Membership should be selected from men of scholarly attainments, devoted
to historical research. This membership should be so catholic as to
include men of all religious denominations and nationalities.

Apropos of this, I beg leave to call attention to the great work done
and being done by German scholars in the study of Celtic, to illustrate
the probable value of assistance that might be rendered to us by men of
other nationalities. The Society should coöperate with the movements in
the other states looking to the establishment of record commissions, and
in states where such movements have not been set on foot, to labor to
create such movements.

With such an inviting field of labor spread out before us, this Society
not only supplies a long-felt want, but also a means of inspiration.
Each member can contribute to the common fund of historical data, and
the sum total of these contributions will go to make up a work of great
value.

The need of such an organization as the American-Irish Historical
Society being demonstrated, and its scope clearly defined, all that
remains to be done to perpetuate its success is to continue in the work
already so auspiciously undertaken.




                THE UNITED STATES TORPEDO-BOAT O’BRIEN.

                    COMPILED FROM THE DAILY PAPERS.


The torpedo-boat _O’Brien_,[57] for the United States navy, was launched
at Lewis Nixon’s “Crescent shipyard,” Elizabethport, N. J., Sept. 24,
1900. She is named the _O’Brien_, to perpetuate the memory of the five
O’Brien brothers,—Jeremiah, Gideon, William, John, and Joseph,—sons of
Maurice O’Brien of Cork, Ireland, who had settled at Machias, Me. The
boys are believed to have all been born in the latter place.

After the news of the battle of Lexington reached Machias, the
townspeople erected a liberty pole, and the fact having been
communicated to the British authorities, the sloop-of-war _Margaretta_,
under the command of Lieutenant Moore of the English navy, was directed
to proceed from Boston to Machias to investigate the matter.

The _Margaretta_ went, and was captured by the O’Briens, after a sharp
fight, May 11, 1775. Lieutenant Moore’s sword was presented to Joseph
O’Brien, he being the “baby” of the expedition. It has been handed down
from father to son ever since. The sword was exhibited at the launching
and attracted no little attention.

The young lady who “christened” the _O’Brien_, Miss Myra Lincoln
O’Brien, is a descendant of Joseph O’Brien, the “baby” above mentioned.
Her father, Albert H. O’Brien, is a lawyer in Philadelphia. He served in
the Civil War, and subsequently in the United States marines, from which
corps he resigned as a first lieutenant in 1875. Her grandfather was
Dennis W. O’Brien of Philadelphia, who died in 1878, while filling the
office of judge of the Orphans’ court of Philadelphia county, and her
great-grandfather was Dennis O’Brien, a merchant of Reading, Pa.

The day was a pleasant one for the launching, and despite the early hour
set for the ceremony, Miss O’Brien, several of her relatives and
friends, Lewis Nixon, Superintendent Ackerman, and the heads of the
various departments were on hand. When the christening party were placed
on the vessel the workmen released the huge hull and the _O’Brien_
gracefully slid from the ways. The launching of the _O’Brien_ marks
another step in the consummation of the government plan of perpetuating
the names of the more prominent figures in the American Revolution. The
O’Briens were a family who possessed indomitable courage and spirit and
played a conspicuous part in this country’s battle for freedom.

It is stated that on the arrival of the _Margaretta_ off Machias, her
commanding officer, Lieutenant Moore, notified the town officials that
the Liberty pole must come down or the vessel would open fire on the
town.

On Sunday morning, May 11, a lumber sloop commanded by Jeremiah O’Brien,
with about fifty men armed with muskets and pitchforks, left the town
and sailed down the bay in the direction of the _Margaretta_. There was
a hand-to-hand fight on the decks, and though the English fought well
with their small arms, the _Margaretta_ was a prize within twenty
minutes. Lieutenant Moore and ten of his men were killed and others
severely wounded, the attacking party losing six men killed, while five
were wounded.

This capture was the first naval engagement of the American
Revolution,[58] but Jeremiah O’Brien and his brothers, William and John,
subsequently received provincial commissions and participated in other
engagements as commanding officers.

The _O’Brien_ is a magnificent boat and looks the fighter, every inch of
her. She is 175 feet long on her water line, 17 feet beam, and of 14
feet, 6 inches draught. Her displacement is about 165 tons. Steel has
been used whenever possible, and when wood has been used it has been
electrically treated so as to be fireproof. In every part unnecessary
weight has been eliminated. The piston rods, shafts, connecting rods and
working parts generally are of nickel steel.

There are four cylinder, triple expansion engines, one high power
cylinder, 18 inches in diameter, one intermediate power cylinder, 27
inches in diameter, and two low power cylinders, 27½ inches in diameter,
each with an 18‒inch stroke. The indicated horse power is 3,500, which
will give 350 revolutions to the screws per minute. There are twin
screws instead of a single screw. The propelling engines are located in
a water-tight compartment.

On board, there is every appliance known to modern naval engineering.
The two condensers each have a cooling surface of 1,500 feet. A
distilling plant for distilling salt water into fresh water is also
supplied in the boat, as well as an air compressing and an electric
lighting plant. Three boilers of the Mosher water-tube design give the
needed power. They are powerfully constructed and will give a working
pressure of 250 pounds to the square inch, with a heating surface of
8,325 square feet. Each boiler is to be supplied with a smoke-pipe
standing about ten feet above the deck.

The _O’Brien_ is low in the water and exceedingly hard to locate at
night, even by the use of searchlights. She is a type of the advanced
fighting machine, and her entire appearance denotes the fighter. Her
armament is as follows: Three torpedo tubes, two forward, one aft, and
three three-pound rapid-fire guns, located as are the torpedo tubes.
When in commission she will carry a Whitehead torpedo in each tube, and
additional ones on the racks near the tubes. The boat will carry sixty
officers and men.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Speaking of the capture of the _Margaretta_, Capt. Edward O’Meagher
Condon, a member of the American-Irish Historical Society, says in his
excellent work:[59] “This was the _first naval fight_ of the Revolution,
and Jeremiah O’Brien was the victorious commander. Two British cruisers,
the _Diligence_ and _Tapnaguish_, were at once despatched to lay Machias
in ashes, but they also were met and captured by O’Brien, his brothers
and comrades. The young hero immediately sailed, with his prizes and
prisoners, for Watertown, Mass., where the Provincial Congress was in
session, and received the thanks of that body and a captain’s
commission. But the British were not yet satisfied. They sent from
Halifax a squadron, including a frigate, a twenty-gun corvette, a brig
of sixteen guns, and several armed schooners, to crush the weak American
fleet; but O’Brien, aided by Colonel Foster, was once more triumphant,
and beat them off after a hard struggle.

“They then sent a strong body of land forces against Machias, but after
the second day’s march from Passamaquoddy the British troops returned to
Halifax, despairing of effecting a passage through the woods, or,
perhaps, hopeless of accomplishing their purpose when confronted by
those who had already conquered their fellow-mercenaries three times at
sea. We are told that Maurice O’Brien, old as he was, could hardly be
restrained from joining his gallant sons in their daring enterprise
against the British.

“Three of the O’Briens, Jeremiah, John and William, continued in the
naval service of the republic until the close of the war. Jeremiah was
appointed to the command of _The Liberty_, and his brother William
served under him as lieutenant. ‘For two years this vessel and another
did good service on the northern coast, affording protection to American
navigation, after which they were laid up.’ Jeremiah, with others, then
fitted out a twenty-gun letter-of-marque, called the _Hannibal_, manned
by one hundred and thirty men.

“She took several prizes; but at length falling in with two British
frigates, she was overhauled after a chase of forty-eight hours and
captured. O’Brien was first confined in the _Jersey_ prison-ship,
otherwise known as the _Hell_, at the Wallabout, where the Brooklyn navy
yard now is. At the end of about six months he was sent to Mill prison,
England, whence he succeeded in effecting his escape about a year later.
He retired after the war to Brunswick, Me., where, at the age of over
fourscore, he furnished the details of his brave achievements to a
generation which had shamefully forgotten him and them.

“John O’Brien was more fortunate than his gallant brother. From a
journal kept by him the following extracts are taken: On June 9, 1779,
he sailed in the armed schooner _Hibernia_. On June 21, he took an
English brig and sent her in. On June 25, he had an engagement with a
ship of seventeen guns, from three till five o’clock p. m., when a
frigate came up and the _Hibernia_ was compelled to leave her
anticipated prize and was pursued by the frigate till midnight. O’Brien
had three men killed and several wounded in this fight. On July 7 he
took a schooner, and sent her to Newburyport. On the day following, in
company with Captain Leach of Salem, he took a ship carrying thirteen
four-pounders; a few hours after, a brig; and then a schooner laden with
molasses. On July 11, he took a brig in ballast, and then chased and
captured another. He adds that if he and Captain Leach had not parted in
a fog they could have taken the whole fleet. Capt. John O’Brien was
never captured by the enemy. No trace is found after the capture of the
_Hannibal_, of Lieut. William O’Brien. He was most probably among the
11,000 victims of British cruelty, whose corpses were buried, or flung
on the shores of the Wallabout.”

                   THE SOCIETY’S FIELD IN CALIFORNIA.

                   BY JAMES CONNOLLY, CORONADO, CAL.


The American-Irish Historical Society is national, broad and
comprehensive. To those familiar with the way in which our race has been
misrepresented or omitted in some histories of California, nothing more
is needed than the mere fact of the existence of such a society as ours
as an inducement to their taking an interest in it. But there are the
great majorities on the other hand who have little time to look into
such matters in out of the way places, before whom I wish to place the
more important purposes and scope of the Society.

Probably no great incentive to the study of the latter phases of this
Society is needed than the fact that during its short existence it has
been extended to over thirty states of the Union and to the District of
Columbia. Most or all of the men who first conceived the need and then
issued the call for its organization are of national reputation in the
several walks of life. The first meeting was held at the Revere House,
Boston, Jan. 20, 1897. Rear Admiral Richard Worsam Meade was then
elected the first president-general. With seven generations of American
ancestry back of him, and brother of the hero of Gettysburg, it would
have been hard to find a more representative man of the race for that
office than he.

In thus honoring him the Society was doubly honoring itself. The race
that gave the new United States navy Commodore Jack Barry, might as well
supply a rear admiral for president of this Society in 1897. The strides
forward during the intervening century have been certainly great. And
to-day the race stands as firmly and fearlessly as it did then, for
freedom. Theodore Roosevelt, governor of the Empire state, who is so
distinguished in literature, war and statecraft that it would be hard to
tell in which he most excels, is among the members.

The mere mention of these names that have come so conspicuously before
the world is not calculated to signify that there are not many others of
almost or quite equal note. Scholars, statesmen and soldiers are
numerous among the Society’s officers and members. But in such a
brotherhood as ours there are no caste barriers. In the common endeavor
for the common good of seeing that American history is truly written, we
meet and act upon common ground.

“Fidelity, truth, honor, are the watchwords,” says the preamble to the
constitution, “and under their noble influence should our work be done.”
Of the nine distinct objects and purposes set forth in Article II of the
constitution, two may be quoted as embodying the more essential features
of our work:

“(2) To investigate specially the immigration of the people of Ireland
to this country, determine its numbers, examine the sources, learn the
places of its settlement, and estimate its influence on contemporary
events in war, legislation, religion, education and other departments of
human activity.”

“(7) To promote by union in a common high purpose a sincere fraternity,
a greater emulation in well doing, a closer confidence and mutual
respect among the various elements of the Irish race in America, that,
by putting behind them the asperities of the past, they may unite in a
common brotherhood with their fellow-citizens for the honor of the race
and the glory of the Republic.”

Nor are the seven other articles of any less importance, that of the
fourth pertaining to the correction of “erroneous, distorted and false
views of history,” and the substitution of truth based upon documentary
evidence, therefor, being amongst the most essential work to be done.
Had we only to deal with our national history, voluminous as it is, the
work before us would seem quite easy.

But there are the almost innumerable state, county, city and town
histories, each of which needs as thorough sifting as does the national.
This fact was indelibly impressed upon my mind three years ago when I
was wading through California state and city histories for kernels of
truth pertaining to “The Precursors of the Pioneers,” and other matter
which I was then writing for publication. Never was the need more
palpably illustrated of keeping well informed on the substance of all
these histories than by a combination of self-constituted “protectors”
of everything American, when they confronted us with accusations of
disloyalty to the Republic and openly sought to insult us with taunts of
being “the Pope’s Irish.” But brief as has been the interval, time has
already doubly vindicated us. When there were Spanish guns to be faced
our accusers stayed bravely at home.

There are no sectarian or religious differences in our Society. Priests
and ministers here unite in bands of blood and brotherhood. We now mourn
the quite recent death of Rev. George W. Pepper, a Methodist minister of
Ohio, one of our ablest workers. Very Rev. Andrew Morrissey, president
of the Catholic University of Notre Dame, is also in our ranks.

I heartily wish that the duty of endeavoring to enlist the interest of
men of Irish blood in California in the organization of a State Chapter
of this Society devolved upon some of the many abler and better equipped
men in the state. But even the keenest sense of one’s own shortcomings
will not justify the shirking of such a duty. Here on the fag end of
things [Coronado] we are few in numbers. In the hot press of the main
chance there seem to be few having time or interest enough to spare to
such a brotherhood. But I am quite sure that in the larger cities of San
Francisco, Sacramento, Stockton and Los Angeles, there are many
patriotic, true men and well-wishers of our race who will cheerfully
join us in organizing a State Chapter, and to these I now appeal for
coöperation to that end.

“Any person of good moral character, who is interested in the special
work of the society, shall be deemed eligible to membership in the same.
No tests other than that of character and devotion to the Society’s
objects shall be applied to membership.” The only charge is an annual
due of three dollars. Persons wishing to become members may send me
their names with addresses and I will send them blanks of application
for membership. These they will fill out and send to me and I will
forward them to the Secretary-General, or they may write directly to
him, addressing Thomas Hamilton Murray, Woonsocket, R. I.

The application must be accompanied by the annual fee. A handsome and
comprehensive volume of the Society’s work is issued each year. The
annual meeting and banquet was held in New York this year, and was a
splendid affair. Let us have a California Chapter of this Society that
will be a fit representative of our state and race.




            THE HISTORICAL PLACE OF IRISHMEN IN CALIFORNIA.

    A CIRCULAR ISSUED BY THE KNIGHTS OF ST. PATRICK, SAN FRANCISCO.


The Knights of St. Patrick of San Francisco, an organization of
gentlemen of Irish birth or descent, has recently affiliated with the
American-Irish Historical Society, whose purpose is the investigation,
recording and presentation in appropriate literary form of the influence
of the Irish element in the upbuilding of the Republic.

The Knights undertake, as their special share of a large and commendable
work, an investigation of the historical place of the Irishman in
California.

Each of the races claiming to form part of the primal stock of the
Republic has its own historical association and has traced the movements
of its own blood by special historical investigation. We have the story
of the English, the Dutch, the Huguenot, the Spaniard. The story of one
of the largest fractions of the parent people of the Republic, the
Irish, is being written.

These special researches are admittedly of the highest value to general
history. They can be prosecuted with the greatest success by particular
work in each state. To this end, the Knights of St. Patrick desire to
initiate a thorough, solid, sober investigation of the Irishman’s part
in the life of California. Not to satisfy a prejudice or mere pride of
race, but laboring for right and truth to impartially set forth the
facts of its racial life, that they may “supply omissions, correct
errors, allay passions and shame prejudice.”

The pioneers of this state, the men who made history, are rapidly
disappearing. With them go the original sources of the most valuable
information. If the work above described be not undertaken now, our
posterity will face the same difficulties that confront our Eastern
brethren in their present search for authentic information.

The Society, therefore, desires to begin its investigations at once and
to extend them to every part of the community, placing them under the
conduct of names that, assuring painstaking research and impartial and
discriminating judgment, will certainly present the results of their
labor in attractive literary form; so that the work, commanding the
respect and attention of the community, may have a definite and
permanent historical value.

The work of investigation is to be influenced neither by political nor
religious divisions. The race is paramount. Whether it came from this
part of Ireland or that; whether it worshiped at this shrine or that, is
but a qualifying incident. We seek the life and labors of the race; to
record its arrival, its participation in the civil, political, and
military activities of the state, “to try truthfully and fearlessly to
record its achievements.”

To this end, we invite and request your coöperation in procuring facts
bearing upon our subject. You may possess original information or know
from whom or where it may be obtained, the location or character of
relics that would be of interest or value. You may be able to suggest a
line of inquiry that would aid our purpose. Historical information flows
from a thousand sources. A reminiscence, a relic, an old newspaper
clipping, a letter, a bit of unwritten biography, may be a clew to
important evidence or the prolific source of many unsuspected facts.

In a word, we ask for any light, however small, that may assist in
illuminating an important subject.

Above all, we ask you not to carelessly cast aside these words. It is
the earnest request of earnest men, seeking truth for its own sake and
wisely providing for the historic vindication of their race and name
from the possible aspersions of future ignorance and prejudice.

The Society will, of course, bear any expense that may be entailed in
the collection, transmission or publication of information proper to our
purpose.

Address all correspondence and any requests for further information,
which we will be pleased to give, to

                                        R. C. O’CONNOR,

                      PUBLICATIONS OF THE SOCIETY.


The following is a list of publications thus far issued by the Society:

  (1.) THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY: WHAT IT IS AND WHAT ITS
    PURPOSES ARE. Boston, Mass., 1897.

This was issued at Boston, some time after the founding of the Society.
It was a small booklet of twelve pages containing a statement of the
Society’s objects, a list of the officers, and other matter bearing upon
the work of the organization. So much interest was displayed, that the
edition was soon exhausted.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  (2.) THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY: WHAT IT IS AND WHAT ITS
    PURPOSES ARE, TOGETHER WITH THE NAMES OF THE OFFICERS AND A LIST OF
    THE MEMBERS. Boston, Mass., 1898.

To a certain extent, this was a second edition of the previous
publication, but larger and more comprehensive. It comprised 32 pages,
and had a portrait of President-General Meade as a frontispiece. The
work is now out of print.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  (3.) THE “SCOTCH-IRISH” SHIBBOLETH ANALYZED AND REJECTED. WITH SOME
    REFERENCE TO THE PRESENT “ANGLO-SAXON” COMEDY. Washington, D. C.,
    1898.

This was a handsomely gotten up pamphlet of 29 pages, the author being a
member of the Society, Joseph Smith, of Lowell, Mass. It was issued in
September, 1898. An edition of 1,500 copies was brought out. A few
copies remain on hand.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  (4.) IRISH SCHOOLMASTERS IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES, 1640‒1775, WITH A
    CONTINUATION OF THE SUBJECT DURING AND AFTER THE WAR OF THE
    REVOLUTION. Washington, D. C., 1898.

This work was issued in August of the year mentioned, the authors being
two members of the Society, Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary-general,
and Hon. John C. Linehan, treasurer-general. It was a very attractive
pamphlet of 31 pages and contained mention of over forty Irish teachers.

                  contained reports concerning the formation of the
                  Society. _The Springfield_ (Mass.) _Republican_ said:
                  “The American-Irish Historical society, organized at
                  Boston yesterday with a remarkable list of officers
                  and the assurance of a charter membership as
                  noteworthy, will prove without question a body of real
                  public importance.... Among those present at the
                  meeting mostly from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
                  Rhode Island, was Edward A. Hall, of this city, whose
                  history of the Irish in Hampden county has grown into
                  a history of the Irish in western Massachusetts,
                  where, in fact, they settled a great number of the
                  hill towns, and their descendants live to this day....
                  It will be the work of the Society to show what a vast
                  influence the Irish element had in building our free
                  commonwealths whose alliance made the first great
                  country of the people, in which with all its faults
                  reposes the hope of the progress of the world into a
                  world of the people instead of one of warring
                  dynasties and vicious religious hatreds, setting
                  nation against nation. We look to this Society for
                  active, earnest, ardent work for the enlightenment,
                  brotherhood and unity of this people first, and of all
                  other peoples in the long event. God hath made of one
                  blood all the nations of the earth.”

 1897. Jan. 21.   Rev. Edmund B. Palmer, Jamaica Plain, Mass., writes a
                  congratulatory letter to Treasurer-General Linehan.

                  Barnabas Palmer of Rochester, N. H., who was born in
                  Cork or Limerick, 1725, and who emigrated from there

                  of the force of 3,000 men, 1745, and on the Isle of
                  Cape Breton, under Fort Louisburg, left his right arm.
                  Subsequently, he settled in Rochester, N. H., married,

                  remains in the family; another ancestor, Samuel, of

                  the family, Samuel, of Weston, commanded a company at

                  delivery of certain forgings, making in Pennsylvania
                  for the _O’Brien_, renders it impossible, at this
                  time, for me to give you even an approximate date for
                  the launching. I am endeavoring to get some
                  information in this matter, and just as soon as I
                  receive it I shall communicate with you.” Mr. Nixon
                  states that he takes pride in the fact that he is
                  “building the _O’Brien_, which is a name honorably and

                  under the present uncertain conditions of weather it
                  is doubtful when the contest will be finished, which

                  two years having taken him up and down the Pacific

  NOTE.—On pages 24, 29, for George E. Van Siclen read George W. Van
  Siclen. In transmitting her valuable paper on “The Irish Settlers of
  Pelham, Mass.,” Miss Linehan of Hartford, Conn., writes relative to
  Shays’ Rebellion: “Daniel Shea,” the acknowledged leader, had his
  name spelled in various ways. In American histories it is spelled
  “Shays.” The writers of these histories have evidently never taken
  very great pains to look up this Irishman. I find that the name is
  spelled Shea, Sheas, Sha, Shays, Shay, also Shess and Shass.
  Spelling in his day was, very evidently, phonetic. As he is said to
  have come from Cork, Ireland, I have no doubt whatever but that he
  originally spelled his name as they do in that country to-day,—Shea.
  In a receipt given before the war he spells the name “Shea.” In a
  note given after the war he spells his name “Shays.” My authority,
  outside of the receipt and note are the town records of Pelham,
  Mass., where the various spelling of the name is given. The
  correspondence between him and Gen. Lincoln, 1787, may be found in
  the Massachusetts Archives, State House, Boston, Mass.

  is gotten up. It marks the progress of the Society and does credit
  to its enterprising secretary-general.”

  From the University of California: “The Regents of the University of
  California acknowledge the receipt of the gift named below, for
  which I am instructed to return their grateful thanks. Very

  From Mr. Edward Fitzpatrick, Louisville (Ky.) _Daily Times_: “I
  thought I would take occasion to write to acknowledge the receipt of
  your recent annual publication. It is very fine, indeed, and I want
  to compliment you on its splendid typographical appearance. It is
  carefully edited, and I think reflects great credit upon you and the
  Society. The indexing is perfect, and the chronology detailing the
  work heretofore done could not, in my opinion, be improved upon.”

  From Hon. P. T. Barry, Chicago, Ill.: “Accept my apology for not
  acknowledging receipt of the second volume of the American-Irish
  Historical Society work before now. The fact is, I have been East,
  and only came across the volume to-day among the accumulation of
  matter that had piled up in my absence. The work is creditable in
  all particulars, and will make a suitable companion to the first
  volume, issued last year. I congratulate you upon its appearance and
  completeness.”

  From Mr. Edward J. McMahon, Worcester, Mass.: “I beg leave to
  acknowledge the receipt from you of Volume II of the Society’s
  Journal, and, in thanking you for this most valuable addition to my
  library, I desire to express something of the pleasure which its
  perusal has given to me this peaceful Sunday afternoon. I am sure
  that my interest in the Society and in its grand work has been
  immensely quickened and that, in the future, I shall try to give
  much more tangible evidence of my membership than I have in the
  past.”

  From the Public Library, Sacramento, Cal.: “The board of trustees of
  Sacramento Free Public Library desire to return their thanks for
  your generous donation of Volume II of the Journal of the
  American-Irish Historical Society. The book has been placed on the
  shelf with the other publications, free to the reading public. By
  order of the board. Samuel H. Gerrish, Secretary. In accordance with
  a resolution of the board of trustees, I hereby acknowledge that I
  have received the above named book. Caroline G. Hancock, Librarian.”

  From Mr. Charles McCarthy, Jr., Portland, Me.: “I thank you very
  much for the second volume of the Journal of the American-Irish
  Historical Society which I received a few days ago, but have not yet
  had time to read much of. I did, however, read Dr. Emmet’s paper on
  ‘Irish Emigration During the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries,’
  and your ‘Irish Chapter in the History of Brown University,’ both of
  which place not only the members of the Society under obligation to
  you, but the Irish race as well. Such papers cannot but be of
  service in wearing away the prejudice of many of our American
  fellow-citizens.”

  From Mr. Joseph Geoghegan, Salt Lake City, Utah: “Dear Mr.
  Murray:—You must excuse my delay in acknowledging the receipt of the
  second volume of the American-Irish Historical Society. I received
  it and was very much pleased, indeed, at its completeness and feel
  that you are to be very highly complimented on your work. It is a
  credit to a society that might have been in existence for a hundred
  years. If at any time the funds of the Society should get into such
  a shape that a call would be necessary, I will be only too pleased
  to respond for any amount that you might suggest.”

  From the librarian of the Long Island Historical Society, Brooklyn,
  N. Y.: “It is with pleasure that I acknowledge your Journal of the
  American-Irish Historical Society, Volume II. From the note at the
  end of the volume, I presume that it will be impossible for us to
  secure your first volume, which we much regret, as it is the kind of
  work that should find a permanent home in a library such as ours,
  which is for reference only. Would it be possible for us to obtain
  any other of your writings, such as the Irish Schoolmasters in the
  Colonies and the Irish Washingtons at Home and Abroad? We would
  appreciate any publication of this kind. We have a library of over
  64,000 volumes.”

  From Hon. James F. Brennan, Peterborough, N. H., state library
  commissioner: “BRO. MURRAY:—I am in receipt of the second volume of
  the Journal of the American-Irish Historical Society, and I wish to
  congratulate you upon its excellent appearance. It shows
  conscientious work on your part. The Chronological Record of the
  Society is a most excellent thing, and the index that you give is
  certainly matchless. I think an index is the most important thing
  about a book of this character, and your work in that regard has
  fulfilled every desire. There is no danger of having an index
  contain too much, but there is great danger of having it contain too
  little. Your earnest work is visible on every page of this volume,
  and I wish to thank you, as a member of the Society, for your
  conscientious labors.”

  Letter from Hon. John D. Crimmins, President-General of the Society.


                     40 EAST 68TH STREET, NEW YORK,
                            APRIL 15, 1901.

MY DEAR MR. MURRAY:—It is with pleasure I acknowledge the receipt of
your advice that the Annual Volume of our Historical Society is about
ready for distribution to our members.

This will be the third volume so distributed, the series showing a
constant increase in historical value and interest. We have undertaken a
task and set a high standard, to which are attached great
responsibilities, which must be maintained and continued. I trust the
end of the twentieth century will find our society still vigorous.

During the last century many pretentious efforts were made to collect
and publish matters of general interest in regard to the Irish and their
descendants in America. They failed primarily for want of an
organization to support their efforts. The organization we have; the
means we require. Work of this character costs much, and cannot be
continued on a scale to do it justice, without a substantial treasury.

We would have ample means modestly to continue our work without
extending it beyond prudent requirements, if each member of the Society
would pay his annual dues.

The honor of belonging to such a Society as ours should be a matter of
pride with our members and everyone should keep in good standing. It is
a requirement that dues should be paid. It would certainly be a
reflection on a member to be dropped, and still there is no alternative.

Any of our annual members may become life members by the payment of $50.
A number of gentlemen have already taken this step, and their generosity
is to be commended as having been specially helpful to the Society. If
this letter be circulated among our members, I would urge as many as
possible to present their names for life membership. From the dues thus
derived, I hope to see established a permanent fund, which when wisely
and safely invested, will assure the Society an income with which to go
forward and enlarge its work.

It should be borne in mind that the American-Irish Historical Society is
not a political organization. Its object is the study and handing down
of Irish and Irish-American history, and it should be brought to the
highest possible standard.

Thus far, our career as an historical organization has been replete with
earnest and successful work. The future is bright for a continuance of
our great mission; the field is large, the cause noble, the end
patriotic, far-reaching, magnificent.

In conclusion let me again urge our members to come forward in answer to
this appeal, with their contributions, large and small. There are but a
few hundred dollars in our treasury, when there should be thousands.

It will be highly encouraging to the officers of the Society to see that
this appeal is met with a prompt and generous response.

With my heartiest and kindest greetings to all our members, believe me

                                        Fraternally,
                                              JOHN D. CRIMMINS,
                                                    _President-General_.

 TO THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,
                 _Secretary-General_.

Footnote 1:

    Hon. George F. Hoar.

Footnote 2:

    State Record Commissioner of Rhode Island.

Footnote 3:

    Mrs. Charles Warren Lippitt.

Footnote 4:

  Secretary-General of the Society.

Footnote 5:

  See Updike’s History of the Narragansett Church.

Footnote 6:

   History of Bristol.

Footnote 7:

  This name appears in the writings of the subject of this paper both as
  “MacSparran” and “McSparran.” In his work “America Dissected,” he
  repeatedly spells it “MacSparran,” while on other occasions he
  frequently uses the abbreviated form “McSparran.”

Footnote 8:

  In Mac Sparran’s time great latitude was exercised, even by educated
  people, in the matter of orthography, including proper names.

Footnote 9:

  It will be noticed that Dr. Mac Sparran never uses the cant term
  “Scotch-Irish.” His education, good sense and patriotic spirit raised
  him above such a subterfuge.

Footnote 10:

  Dean Berkeley, the famous “Kilkenny scholar,” located near Newport, R.
  I., in 1729, and on various occasions visited MacSparran. Berkeley was
  subsequently made Anglican bishop of Cloyne, in Ireland.

Footnote 11:

  Recently deceased. Librarian of the Rhode Island Historical Society.

Footnote 12:

  A small remnant of the Narragansett nation still exists, chiefly at or
  near Westerly, R. I. Few, if any, of these survivors, are of pure
  Indian blood.

Footnote 13:

  The claim has been made that the slaves were kindly treated in Rhode
  Island. No doubt they were in many cases, but so, in some instances,
  were those in the South. Still, at the best it was slavery, and the
  very nature of this traffic in human beings must have been equivalent
  to injustice, oppression and cruelty.

Footnote 14:

  This Dr. Giles Goddard was the father of William Goddard who, in 1762,
  established the Providence (R. I.) _Gazette_, the first paper ever
  printed at Providence.

Footnote 15:

  Captain Wilkinson was an Irishman who resided at Newport, but was an
  intimate friend of Dr. MacSparran, Col. Updike and other prominent
  Narragansett people.

Footnote 16:

  In Narragansett, R. I.

Footnote 17:

  This was Gilbert Stuart, who afterwards became the famous painter. The
  name in MacSparran’s time appears to have also been spelled Stewart.

Footnote 18:

  “America Dissected.”

Footnote 19:

  “America Dissected.”

Footnote 20:

  A monument to MacSparran stands in North Kingstown, R. I. A hill in
  that section of the state also bears his name.

Footnote 21:

  On the staff of the _Boston Daily Globe_.

Footnote 22:

  Treasurer-General of the Society, and State Insurance Commissioner of
  New Hampshire.

Footnote 23:

  Ramsay’s History was written by the son of an Irish Protestant. An
  edition was published in 1805 by Mathew Carey, a native-born Irish
  Catholic. A list of subscribers to the work was printed with it and
  here also is another instance of the presence of the Gael. The name of
  Thomas Addis Emmet appropriately heads the list, and the names
  following are Irish enough to please the most blue-blooded Milesian:
  James Buckley, Matthew Carroll, Philip Whelpley, Katherine Mulligan,
  James Doyle, J. W. McFadden, Charles O’Neal, John D. Toy, Henry C.
  Neal, Daniel Fagan, Andrew Fleming, William Hickey, John McLeod,
  Bernard O’Neal, John H. Riley, William Carroll, Patrick Gill, John
  McDermott, John McBride, M. Sullivan, Francis D. Riordan, Peter Kerr,
  John Carney, John Carey, John Cowan, Anthony C. Curley, Hamson Kelly,
  James McElhinney, Hugh McGuire, John McDonald, A. D. Murphy, Harvey
  Bryan, C. P. Butler, Lydia Bryan, Bartholomew Carroll, Richard
  Cunningham, Catherine Fitzsimmons, Christopher Fitzsimmons, Daniel
  Flood, Richard Fair, Andrew Flynn, Peter Murphy, Richard McCormack,
  Samuel Nolan, Cornelius Driscoll, Dennis O’Driscoll, Henry O’Hara,
  Thomas H. Egan, Peter McGuire, John Murphy, Joseph Kelly, Patrick
  Noble, John B. O’Neal, Timothy Dargan, Patrick H. Carns, Patrick
  Gatlin, Robert Malone, J. S. Bryan, and Daniel Murphy.

Footnote 24:

  Recently deceased. Mr. Walsh was a founder of our society and was
  vice-president for Georgia. He had been a United States senator from
  that state, and was editor and publisher of the _Augusta_ (Ga.)
  _Chronicle_, one of the leading dailies of the South. The article here
  given is a condensation of an address delivered by him a few years ago
  at Nashville, on “Irish-American Day” at the Tennessee Exposition.

Footnote 25:

  Shattuck’s History of Concord, p. 215. But little is known of
  Cargill’s life. When Shattuck wrote (1852) he said, “What little is
  known of his life is better stated in his epitaph than from any
  information I possess.”

  There is a tradition that it was he who first introduced potatoes to
  Rhode Island, bringing them from Ireland.

Footnote 49:

  From a letter written to the author, by a descendant of Matthew, some
  years ago.

Footnote 50:

  After Matthew Watson’s death, the clay pits remained idle for years,
  and a young forest gradually grew up.

Footnote 51:

  Watson sold his brick in Newport and New York, as well as in other
  places. Bicknell says that “the brick mansions of some of the old
  Manhattan families were probably made of Barrington clay.”

Footnote 52:

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
