odotus and Strabo inform us that, among the Massagetæ every man had
his own wife, but that all the other men of the tribe were allowed to
have sexual intercourse with her.[250] The Auseans, a Libyan people,
had, according to the former, their wives in common;[251] and Solinus
reports the same of the Garamantians of Ethiopia.[252] Community
of women is, further, alleged to have occurred among the Liburnes,
Galactophagi,[253] and the ancient Bohemians.[254] And Garcilasso de la
Vega asserts that, among the natives of Passau in Peru, before the time
of the Incas, men had no separate wives.[255]

To these statements of ancient peoples Sir J. Lubbock adds a few others
concerning modern savages.[256] “The Bushmen of South Africa,” he
says, “are stated to be entirely without marriage.” Sir Edward Belcher
tells us that, in the Andaman Islands, the custom is for the man and
woman to remain together until the child is weaned, when they separate,
and each seeks a new partner.[257] Speaking of the natives of Queen
Charlotte Islands, Mr. Poole says that among them “the institution
of marriage is altogether unknown,” and that the women “cohabit
almost promiscuously with their own tribe, though rarely with other
tribes.”[258] In the Californian Peninsula, according to Baegert, the
sexes met without any formalities, and their vocabulary did not even
contain the word “to marry.”[259] Mr. Hyde states that, in the Pacific
Islands, there was an “utter absence of what we mean by the family,
the household, and the husband; the only thing possible was to keep
the line distinct through the mother, and enumerate the successive
generations with the several putative fathers.”[260] Among the Nairs,
as Buchanan tells us, no one knows his father, and every man looks on
his sister’s children as his heirs; a man may marry several women,
and a woman may be the wife of several men.[261] The Teehurs of Oude
live together almost indiscriminately in large communities, and even
when two people are regarded as married the tie is but nominal.[262]
It is recorded that, among the Tôttiyars of India, “brothers, uncles,
nephews, and other kindred, hold their wives in common.”[263] And
among the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills, when a man marries a girl,
she becomes the wife of all his brothers as they successively reach
manhood, and they become the husbands of all her sisters when they are
old enough to marry.[264]

The Kámilarói tribes in South Australia are divided into four clans,
in which brothers and sisters are respectively Ipai and Ipātha, Kŭbi
and Kubĭtha, Mŭri and Mātha, Kumbu and Būtha. Ipai may only marry
Kubĭtha; Kŭbi, Ipātha; Kumbu, Mātha; and Mŭri, Būtha. In a certain
sense, we are told, every Ipai is regarded as married, not by any
individual contract, but by organic law, to every Kubĭtha; every Kŭbi
to every Ipātha, and so on. If, for instance, a Kŭbi “meet a stranger
Ipātha, they address each other as _spouse_. A Kŭbi thus meeting an
Ipātha, though she were of another tribe, would treat her as his
wife, and his right to do so would be recognised by her tribe.”[265]
This institution, according to which the men of one division, have as
wives the women of another division, the Rev. L. Fison calls “group
marriage.” He contends that, among the South Australians, it has given
way in later times, in some measure, to individual marriage. But
theoretically, as he says, marriage is still communal: “it is based
upon the marriage of all the males in one division of a tribe to all
the females of the same generation in another division.” To this may
be added a statement of the Rev. C. W. Schürmann with reference to the
Port Lincoln aborigines. “As for near relatives, such as brothers,”
he remarks, “it may almost be said that they have their wives in
common.... A peculiar nomenclature has arisen from these singular
connections; a woman honours the brothers of the man to whom she is
married with the indiscriminate name of husbands; but the men make
a distinction, calling their own individual spouses yungaras, and
those to whom they have a secondary claim, by right of brotherhood,
kartetis.”[266]

Speaking of the Fuegians, Admiral Fitzroy says, “We had some reason to
think there were parties who lived in a promiscuous manner—a few women
being with many men.”[267] The Lubus of Sumatra, the Olo Ot, together
with a few other tribes of Borneo, the Poggi Islanders, the Orang Sakai
of Malacca, and the mountaineers of Peling, east of Celebes, are by
Professor Wilken stated to be entirely without marriage.[268] The same
is said by Professor Bastian to be the case with the Keriahs, Kurumbas,
Chittagong tribes, Guaycurûs, Kutchin Indians, and Arawaks.[269] He
states, too, that the Jolah on the island of St. Mary, according to
Hewett, possess their women in common,[270] and that, according to
Magalhães, the like is true of the Cahyapos in Matto Grosso.[271] We
read in Dapper’s old book on Africa, that certain negro tribes had
neither law, nor religion, nor any proper names, and possessed their
wives in common.[272] These are all the statements known to me of
peoples alleged to be without marriage.

In the first place, it must be remarked that some of the facts adduced
are not really instances of promiscuity. Sir Edward Belcher’s statement
as regards the Andamanese evidently suggests monogamy; and among the
Massagetæ and the Teehurs, the occurrence of marriage is expressly
confirmed, though the marriage tie was loose. As for the aborigines
of the Californian Peninsula, it must be remembered that the want of
an equivalent for the verb “to marry” does not imply the want of
the fact itself. Baegert indicates, indeed, that marriage did occur
among them, when he says that “each man took as many wives as he
liked, and if there were several sisters in a family he married them
all together.”[273] And throughout the Pacific Islands, marriage is
a recognized institution. Nowhere has debauchery been practised more
extensively than among the Areois of Tahiti. Yet Mr. Ellis assures us
that, “although addicted to every kind of licentiousness themselves,
each Arcoi had his own wife; ... and so jealous were they in this
respect that improper conduct towards the wife of one of their own
number was sometimes punished with death.”[274]

As to the South Australians, Mr. Fison’s statements have caused not a
little confusion. On his authority several writers assert that, among
the Australian savages, groups of males are actually found united to
groups of females.[275] But after all, Mr. Fison does not seem really
to mean to affirm the present existence of group-marriages. The chief
argument advanced by him in support of his theory is grounded on the
terms of relationship in use in the tribes. These terms belong to the
“classificatory system” of Mr. Morgan;[276] but Mr. Fison admits that
he is not aware of any tribe in which the actual practice is to its
full extent what the terms of relationship imply. “Present usage,”
he says, “is everywhere in advance of the system so implied, and the
terms are survivals of an ancient right, not precise indications of
custom as it is.”[277] The same is granted by Mr. Howitt.[278] Yet it
will be pointed out further on to what absurd results we must be led,
if, guided by such terms, we begin to speculate upon early marriage.
Moreover, if a Kŭbi and an Ipātha address each other as spouse, this
does not imply that in former times every Kŭbi was married to every
Ipātha indiscriminately. On the contrary, the application of such a
familiar term might be explained from the fact that the women who may
be a man’s wives, and those who cannot possibly be so, stand in a
widely different relation to him.[279] It seems also as if a communism
in wives among the Port Lincoln aborigines had been inferred by Mr.
Schürmann chiefly from the nomenclature. Indeed, Mr. Curr, who has
procured more information regarding the Australian aborigines than
any other investigator, so far as I know, states that, in Australia,
men and women have never been found living in a state of promiscuous
intercourse, but _the reverse is a matter of notoriety_.[280] “It
seems to me,” he says, “after a careful examination of the subject,
that there is not within our knowledge a single fact, or linguistic
expression which requires us to have recourse to the theory of
group-marriage to explain it, but that there are several ... directly
at variance with that theory.”[281] The Rev. John Mathew asserts also,
in his recent paper on ‘The Australian Aborigines,’ that he fails to
see that group-marriage “has been proven to exist in the past, and it
certainly does not occur in Australia now.”[282] At any rate, it may be
asserted that such group-marriages are different from the promiscuity
which is presumed to have prevailed in primitive society. And this may
with even more reason be said of the marriages of the Tôttiyars, Nairs
and Todas, of which at least those of the Todas have originated, I
believe, in true polyandry.

Many of the assertions made as to peoples living together promiscuously
are evidently erroneous. Travellers are often apt to misapprehend the
manners and customs of the peoples they visit, and we should therefore,
if possible, compare the statements of different writers, especially
when so delicate and private a matter as the relation between the sexes
is concerned. Sir Edward Belcher’s statement about the Andamanese has
been disproved by Mr. Man, who, after a very careful investigation of
this people, says not only that they are strictly monogamous, but that
divorce is unknown, and conjugal fidelity till death not the exception
but the rule among them.[283] As regards the Bushmans, Sir John Lubbock
does not indicate the source from which he has taken the statement
that they are “entirely without marriage;” all the authorities I have
consulted, unanimously assert the reverse. Burchell was told that even
a second wife is never taken until the first has become old, and that
the old wives remain with the husband on the same terms as before.[284]
Barrow tells us almost the same.[285] Indeed, as we have already seen,
the family is the chief social institution of this people.

With reference to the Fuegians, Mr. Bridges, who has lived amongst
them for thirty years, writes to me, “Admiral Fitzroy’s supposition
concerning parties among the natives who lived promiscuously is false,
and adultery and lewdness are condemned as evil, though through the
strength of animal passions very generally indulged, but never with
the consent of husbands or wives, or of parents.” From the description
of Captain Jacobsen’s recent voyage to the North-Western Coast of
North America, it appears that marriage exists among the Queen
Charlotte Islanders also, although the husbands often prostitute their
wives.[286] As for Professor Wilken’s statements about promiscuity
among some peoples belonging to the Malay race, Professor Ratzel calls
their accuracy in question. At least, among the Lubus, as Herr Van
Ophuijsen assures us, a man has to buy his wife, just as among the
other Malay peoples;[287] and Dr. Schwaner expressly says that all that
we know about the Olo Ot depends on hearsay only.[288] But, according
to him, they are not without marriage.[289]

Some of Professor Bastian’s assertions are most astonishing. Any one
who takes the trouble to read Richardson’s, Kirby’s, or Bancroft’s
account of the Kutchin, will find that polygyny, but not promiscuity,
is prevalent among them, the husbands being very jealous of their
wives.[290] The same is stated by v. Martius about the Arawaks, whose
blood-feuds are generally owing to jealousy and a desire to avenge
violations of conjugal rights.[291] The occurrence of marriage among
them has also been ascertained by Schomburgk and the Rev. W. H.
Brett.[292] The Guaycurûs are said by Lozano to be monogamous,[293]
and so, according to Captain Lewin, are as a rule the Chittagong Hill
tribes, as we shall find later on. Touching the Keriahs, Colonel Dalton
affirms only that they have no word for marriage in their own language,
but he does not deny that marriage itself occurs among them; on the
contrary, it appears that they buy their wives.[294] The Kurumbas
are stated to be without the marriage ceremony, but not without
marriage.[295] And Dapper’s assertion that certain negro tribes have
their women in common, has never, so far as I know, been confirmed by
more recent writers. Dr. Post has found no people in Africa living in
a state of promiscuity;[296] and Mr. Ingham informs me, speaking of
the Bakongo, that “they would be horrified at the idea of promiscuous
intercourse.”

The peoples who may possibly live in a state of promiscuity have thus
been reduced to a very small number. Considering the erroneousness of
so many of the statements on the subject, it is difficult to believe in
the accuracy of the others.[297] Ethnography was not seriously studied
by the ancients, and their knowledge of the African tribes was no doubt
very deficient. Pliny, in the same chapter where he states that, among
the Garamantians, men and women lived in promiscuous intercourse,
reports of another African tribe, the Blemmyans, that they had no head,
and that the mouth and eyes were in the breast.[298] Besides, marriage
is an ambiguous word. The looseness of the marital tie, the frequency
of adultery and divorce, and the absence of the marriage ceremony may
entitle us to say that, among many savage peoples, marriage in the
European sense of the term does not exist. But this is very different
from promiscuity.

Even if some of the statements are right, and the intercourse between
the sexes among a few peoples really is, or has been, promiscuous,
it would be a mistake to infer that these utterly exceptional cases
represent a stage of human development which mankind, as a whole,
has gone through. Further, nothing would entitle us to consider
this promiscuity as a survival of the primitive life of man, or
even as a mark of a very rude state of society. It is by no means
among the lowest peoples that sexual relations most nearly approach
to promiscuity. Mr. Rowney, for instance, states that, among the
Butias, the marriage tie is so loose that chastity is quite unknown,
that the husbands are indifferent to the honour of their wives, that
“the intercourse of the sexes is, in fact, promiscuous.” But the
Butias are followers of Buddha, and “can hardly be counted among
the _wild_ tribes of India, for they are, for the most part, in
good circumstances, and have a certain amount of civilization among
them.”[299] On the other hand, among the lowest races on earth, as
the Veddahs, Fuegians, and Australians, the relation of the sexes are
of a much more definite character. The Veddahs are a truly monogamous
people, and have a saying that “death alone separates husband and
wife.”[300] And with reference to the Australians, Mr. Brough Smyth,
states that “though the marriages of Aboriginals are not solemnized
by any rites, ... it must not be supposed that, as a rule, there is
anything like promiscuous intercourse. When a man obtains a good wife,
he keeps her as a precious possession, as long as she is fit to help
him, and minister to his wants, and increase his happiness. No other
man must look with affection towards her.... Promiscuous intercourse is
abhorrent to many of them.” Among the aborigines of the northern and
central parts of Australia, there are certainly women wholly given up
to common lewdness, and a man is said to be considered a bad host who
will not lend his wife to a guest. But Mr. Brough Smyth thinks that
these practices are modern, and have been acquired since the aborigines
were brought in contact with the lower class of the whites, for “they
are altogether irreconcilable with the penal laws in force in former
times amongst the natives of Victoria.”[301] It seems obvious, then,
that even if there are peoples who actually live promiscuously, these
do not afford any evidence whatever for promiscuity having prevailed
in primitive times. Now let us examine whether the other arguments are
more convincing.

       *       *       *       *       *

“A further fact,” Dr. Post says, “which speaks for sexual intercourse
having originally been unchecked, is the wide-spread custom that the
sexes may cohabit perfectly freely previous to marriage.”[302]

The immorality of many savages is certainly very great, but we must
not believe that it is characteristic of uncivilized races in general.
There are numerous savage and barbarous peoples among whom sexual
intercourse out of wedlock is of rare occurrence, unchastity, at least
on the part of the woman, being looked upon as a disgrace and even as a
crime.

“A Kafir woman,” Barrow says, “is chaste and extremely modest;”[303]
and Mr. Cousins writes to me that, between their various feasts,
the Kafirs, both men and women, have to live in strict continence,
the penalty being banishment from the tribe, if this law is broken.
Proyart states that, among the people of Loango, “a youth durst not
speak to a girl except in her mother’s presence,” and “the crime of
a maid who has not resisted seduction, would be sufficient to draw
down a total ruin on the whole country, were it not expiated by a
public avowal made to the king.”[304] Among the Equatorial Africans,
mentioned by Mr. Winwood Reade, a girl who disgraces her family by
wantonness is banished from her clan; and, in cases of seduction, the
man is severely flogged.[305] In Dahomey, if a man seduces a girl,
the law compels marriage, and the payment of eighty cowries to the
parent or master.[306] In Tessaua, according to Dr. Barth, a fine
of 100,000 kurdi is imposed on the father of a bastard child—a sum
which indicates how seldom such children are born there.[307] Among
the Beni-Mzab, a man who seduces a young girl has to pay two hundred
francs, and is banished for four years.[308] Among the Beni-Amer,
according to Munzinger, the unmarried women are very modest, though
the married women believe that they are allowed everything.[309] Among
the Arab girls in Upper Egypt, unchastity is made impossible by an
operation when they are from three to five years old;[310] and among
the Marea, continence is a scarcely less necessary virtue, as a maiden
or widow who becomes pregnant is killed together with the seducer and
the child.[311] As regards the Kabyles, Messrs. Hanoteau and Letourneux
assert, “Les mœurs ne tolèrent même aucune relation sexuelle en dehors
du mariage.... L’enfant né en dehors du mariage est tué ainsi que sa
mère.”[312]

Among the Central Asian Turks, according to Vámbéry, a fallen girl is
unknown.[313] Among the Kalmucks,[314] as also the Gypsies,[315] the
girls take pride in having gallant affairs, but are dishonoured if
they have children previous to marriage. A seducer among the Tunguses
is bound to marry his victim and pay the price claimed for her.[316]
In Circassia, an incontinent daughter is generally sold as soon as
possible, being a disgrace to her parents.[317] Among the wretched
inhabitants of Lob-nor, “immorality is severely punished.”[318] And
regarding the Let-htas, a Hill Tribe of Burma, Mr. O’Riley states that,
until married, the youth of both sexes are domiciled in two long houses
at opposite ends of the village, and “when they may have occasion
to pass each other, they avert their gaze, so they may not see each
other’s faces.”[319]

As to the aborigines of the Indian Archipelago, Professor Wilken states
that side by side with peoples who indulge in great licentiousness,
there are others who are remarkably chaste. Thus, in Nias, the
pregnancy of an unmarried girl is punished with death, inflicted
not only upon her but upon the seducer.[320] Among the Hill Dyaks,
the young men are carefully separated from the girls, licentious
connections between the sexes being strictly prohibited;[321] and
the Sibuyaus, a tribe belonging to the Sea Dyaks, though they do not
consider the sexual intercourse of their young people a positive crime,
yet attach an idea of great indecency to irregular connections, and are
of opinion that an unmarried woman with child must be offensive to the
superior powers.[322]

By some of the independent tribes of the Philippines also, according
to Chamisso, chastity is held in great honour, “not only among the
women, but also among the young girls, and is protected by very severe
laws;”[323]—a statement which is confirmed by Dr. Hans Meyer and
Professor Blumentritt with reference to the Igorrotes of Luzon.[324]

In New Guinea, too, chastity is strictly maintained.[325] Mr. G.
A. Robinson and the Catechist Clark, who lived for years with the
aborigines, both declare their belief in the virtue of the young
women;[326] and Dr. Finsch assures us that the natives of Dory are,
in that respect, superior to many civilized nations in Europe.[327]
The French naturalists and some English writers spoke highly of the
morality of the young people among the Tasmanians.[328] The women of
Uea, Loyalty Islands, are described by Erskine as “strictly chaste
before marriage, and faithful wives afterwards.”[329] In Fiji, great
continence prevailed among the young folk, the lads being forbidden to
approach women till eighteen or twenty years old.[330] Speaking of the
aborigines of Melanesia, Dr. Codrington remarks, “It is certain that
in these islands generally there was by no means that insensibility
in regard to female virtue with which the natives are so commonly
charged.”[331] In Samoa, the girls were allowed to cohabit with
foreigners, but not with their countrymen,[332] and the chastity of the
chiefs’ daughters was the pride of the tribe. But Mr. Turner remarks
that, though this virtue was ostensibly cultivated here by both sexes,
it was more a name than a reality.[333]

With reference to the Australian natives, Mr. Moore Davis says,
“Promiscuous intercourse between the sexes is not practised by the
Aborigines, and their laws on the subject, particularly those of New
South Wales, are very strict. When at camp, all the young unmarried
men are stationed by themselves at the extreme ends, while the married
men, each with his family, occupy the centre. No conversation is
allowed between the single men and the girls or the married women....
Infractions of these and other laws were visited either by punishment
by any aggrieved member of the tribe, or by the delinquent having
to purge himself of his crime by standing up protected simply by
his shield, or a waddy, while five or six warriors threw, from a
comparatively short distance, several spears at him.”[334] Concerning
several tribes in Western Victoria, Mr. Dawson likewise states that,
at the corroborees and great meetings of the tribes, unmarried adults
of both sexes are kept strictly apart from those of another tribe.
“Illegitimacy is rare,” he says, “and is looked upon with such
abhorrence that the mother is always severely beaten by her relatives,
and sometimes put to death and burned. Her child is occasionally killed
and burned with her. The father of the child is also punished with the
greatest severity, and occasionally killed.”[335]

Turning to the American peoples: among the early Aleuts, according to
Veniaminof, “girls or unmarried females who gave birth to illegitimate
children were to be killed for shame, and hidden.”[336] Egede tells us
that, among the Greenlanders, unmarried women observed the rules of
modesty much better than married women. “During fifteen full years
that I lived in Greenland,” he says, “I did not hear of more than two
or three young women, who were gotten with child unmarried; because
it is reckoned the greatest of infamies.”[337] According to Cranz, a
Greenland maid would take it as an affront were a young fellow even to
offer her a pinch of snuff in company.[338] Among the Northern Indians,
girls are from the early age of eight or nine years prohibited by
custom from joining in the most innocent amusements with children of
the opposite sex. “When sitting in their tent,” says Hearne, “or even
when travelling, they are watched and guarded with such an unremitting
attention as cannot be exceeded by the most rigid discipline of an
English boarding-school.”[339] Mr. Catlin asserts that, among the
Mandans, female virtue is, in the respectable families, as highly
cherished as in any society whatever.[340] Among the Nez Percés,[341]
the Apaches,[342] and certain other North American peoples,[343] the
women are described as remarkably chaste, the seducer being viewed by
some of them with even more contempt than the girl he has dishonoured.
And Dobrizhoffer praises the Abiponian women for their virtuous
life.[344]

If we add to these facts those which will be adduced further on,
showing what man requires in his bride, it must be admitted that
the number of uncivilized peoples among whom chastity, at least as
regards women, is held in honour and, as a rule, cultivated, is very
considerable. There being nothing to indicate that the morality of
those nations ever was laxer, the inference of an earlier stage of
promiscuity from the irregular sexual relations of unmarried people,
could not apply to them, even if such an inference, on the whole,
were right. But this is far from being the case: first, because the
wantonness of savages, in several cases, seems to be due chiefly to the
influence of civilization; secondly, because it is quite different from
promiscuity.

It has been sufficiently proved that contact with a higher culture,
or, more properly, the dregs of it, is pernicious to the morality of
peoples living in a more or less primitive condition. In Greenland,
says Dr. Nansen, “the Eskimo women of the larger colonies are far
freer in their ways than those of the small outlying settlements where
there are no Europeans.”[345] And the Yokuts of California, amongst
whom the freedom of the unmarried people of both sexes is very great
now, are said to have been comparatively virtuous before the arrival
of the Americans.[346] In British Columbia and Vancouver Island,
“amongst the interior tribes, in primitive times, breaches of chastity
on the part either of married or unmarried females were often punished
with death, inflicted either by the brother or husband;” whilst, among
the fish-eaters of the north-west coast, “it has no meaning, or, if
it has, it appears to be utterly disregarded.”[347] Again, among the
Queen Charlotte Islanders the present depravation has, according to
Captain Jacobsen been caused by the gold diggers who went there in the
middle of this century.[348] Admiral Fitzroy observed, too, that the
unchastity of the Patagonian women did not correspond with the pure
character attributed to them at an earlier time by Falkner, and he
thinks that “their ideas of propriety may have been altered by the
visits of licentious strangers.”[349] A more recent traveller, Captain
Musters, observed, indeed, little immorality amongst the Indians whilst
in their native wilds.[350]

There is, further, no doubt that the licentiousness of many South
Sea Islanders, at least to some extent, owes its origin to their
intercourse with Europeans. When visiting the Sandwich Islands with
Cook, Vancouver saw little or no appearance of wantonness among the
women. But when he visited them some years afterwards, it was very
conspicuous; and he ascribes this change in their habits to their
intercourse with foreigners.[351] Owing to the same influence, the
women of Ponapé and Tana lost their modesty;[352] and the privileges
granted to foreigners in Samoa have been already mentioned. Nay, even
in Tahiti, so notorious for the licentiousness of its inhabitants,
immorality was formerly less than it is now. Thus, as a girl, betrothed
when a child, grew up, “for the preservation of her chastity, a small
platform of considerable elevation was erected for her abode within the
dwelling of her parents. Here she slept and spent the whole of the time
she passed within doors. Her parents, or some member of the family,
attended her by night and by day, supplied her with every necessary,
and accompanied her whenever she left the house. Some of their
traditions,” Ellis adds, “warrant the inference that this mode of
life, in early years, was observed by other females besides those who
were betrothed.”[353]

Speaking of the tribes who once inhabited the Adelaide Plains of South
Australia, Mr. Edward Stephens, who went to Australia about half a
century ago, remarks, “Those who speak of the natives as a naturally
degraded race, either do not speak from experience, or they judge them
by what they have become when the abuse of intoxicants and contact with
the most wicked of the white race have begun their deadly work. As a
rule, to which there are no exceptions, if a tribe of blacks is found
away from the white settlement, the more vicious of the white men are
most anxious to make the acquaintance of the natives, and that, too,
solely for purposes of immorality.... I saw the natives and was much
with them before those dreadful immoralities were well known, ... and I
say it fearlessly, that nearly all their evils they owed to the white
man’s immorality and to the white man’s drink.”[354]

The Rev. J. Sibree tells us that, among most of the tribes of
Madagascar, the unchastity of girls does not give umbrage. But “there
are some other tribes,” he says, “more isolated, as certain of the
eastern peoples, where a higher standard of morality prevails, girls
being kept scrupulously from any intercourse with the other sex until
they are married.”[355]

Nowhere has chastity been more rigorously insisted upon than among the
South Slavonians. A fallen girl among them has lost almost all chance
of getting married. She is commonly despised and often punished in a
very barbarous way; whilst, on the other hand, purity gives a girl a
higher value than the greatest wealth. In some places, a father or a
brother may even kill a man whom he finds with his daughter or sister.
But Dr. Krauss assures us that this rigidity in their morals has
gradually decreased, the more foreign civilization has got a footing
among them.[356]

Again, Professor Ahlqvist believes that illicit intercourse between the
sexes was almost unknown among the ancient Finns, as the terms used
by them with reference to such connections are borrowed from other
languages.[357] And Professor Vámbéry makes the same observation as
regards the primitive Turko-Tartars. “The difference in morality,”
he says, “which exists between the Turks affected by a foreign
civilization and kindred tribes inhabiting the steppes, becomes very
conspicuous to any one living among the Turkomans and Kara-Kalpaks; for
whether in Africa or Asia, certain vices are introduced only by the
so-called bearers of culture.”[358]

Apart from such cases of foreign influence, we may perhaps say that
irregular connections between the sexes have on the whole exhibited
a tendency to increase along with the progress of civilization. Dr.
Fritsch remarks that the Bushmans are much stricter in that matter
than their far more advanced neighbours.[359] Robert Drury assures
us that, in Madagascar, “there are more modest women, in proportion
to the number of people, than in England.”[360] Tacitus praised the
chastity of the Germanic youth, in contrast to the licentiousness of
the highly civilized Romans. These statements may to a certain extent
be considered typical. In Europe, there are born among towns-people, on
an average, twice as many bastard children, in proportion to the number
of births, as among the inhabitants of the country, who generally
lead a more natural life. In France, according to Wappäus, the ratio
was found even so great as 15·13 to 4·24; though in Saxony, with its
manufacturing country people, it was only as 15·39 to 14·64.[361] Nay,
in Gratz and Munich the illegitimate births are even more numerous
than the legitimate.[362] The prostitution of the towns makes the
difference in morality still greater; and unfortunately the evil is
growing. Almost everywhere prostitution increases in a higher ratio
than population.[363] In consideration of these facts, it is almost
ridiculous to speak of the immorality of unmarried people among savages
as a relic of an alleged primitive stage of promiscuity.

There are several factors in civilization which account for this bad
result. The more unnatural mode of living and the greater number of
excitements exercise, no doubt, a deteriorating influence on morality;
and poverty makes prostitutes of many girls who are little more than
children. But the chief factor is the growing number of unmarried
people. It is proved that, in the cities of Europe, prostitution
increases according as the number of marriages decreases.[364] It has
also been established, thanks to the statistical investigations of
Engel and others, that the fewer the marriages contracted in a year,
the greater is the ratio of illegitimate births.[365] Thus, by making
celibacy more common, civilization promotes sexual irregularity. It
is true that more elevated moral feelings, concomitants of a higher
mental development, may, to a certain extent, put the drag on passion.
But in a savage condition of life, where every full-grown man marries
as soon as possible; where almost every girl, when she reaches the age
of puberty, is given in marriage; where, consequently, bachelors and
spinsters are of rare occurrence,—there is comparatively little reason
for illegitimate relations.[366] Marriage, it seems to me, is the
natural form of the sexual relations of man, as of his nearest allies
among the lower animals. Far from being a relic of the primitive life
of man, irregularity in this respect is an anomaly arising chiefly from
circumstances associated with certain stages of human development.

Dr. Post’s argument, as I have said, is open to another objection. Free
sexual intercourse previous to marriage is quite a different thing
from promiscuity, the most genuine form of which is prostitution. But
prostitution is rare among peoples living in a state of nature and
unaffected by foreign influence.[367] It is contrary to woman’s natural
feelings as involving a suppression of individual inclinations. In free
sexual intercourse there is selection; a woman has for one man, or for
several men, a preference which generally makes the connections more
durable.

Nowhere are unmarried people of both sexes less restrained than among
the savage nations of India and Indo-China. Yet among these savage
nations there is no promiscuity. Among the Toungtha, for instance,
according to Captain Lewin, prostitution is not understood, and, when
explained, it is regarded by them with abhorrence. “They draw rightly
a strong distinction between a woman prostituting herself habitually
as a means of livelihood, and the intercourse by mutual consent of
two members of opposite sexes, leading, as it generally does, to
marriage.”[368] Among the Tipperahs,[369] Oráons,[370] and Kolyas[371],
unmarried girls may cohabit freely with young men, but are never found
living promiscuously with them. Among the Dyaks on the Batang Lupar,
too, unchastity is not rare, but a woman usually confines herself
to one lover. “Should the girl prove with child,” says Sir Spenser
St. John, “it is an understanding between them that they marry”;
and the men seldom, by denying the paternity, refuse to fulfil their
engagements.[372] Again, in Tonga, it was considered disgraceful for a
girl to change lovers often. And in Scotland, prior to the Reformation,
there was a practice called “hand-fasting,” which certainly may be
characterized as unrestrained freedom before marriage, but not as
promiscuity. “At the public fairs,” the Rev. Ch. Rogers states, “men
selected female companions with whom to cohabit for a year. At the
expiry of this period both parties were accounted free; they might
either unite in marriage or live singly.”[373]

The attempt to explain free intercourse between unmarried people as
a relic of a primitive condition of general promiscuity or rather,
to infer the latter from the former, must thus, in every respect, be
considered a complete failure.

Sir John Lubbock thinks that his hypothesis of “communal marriage”
derives additional support from some curious customs, which he
interprets as acts of expiation for individual marriage. “In many
cases,” he says, “the exclusive possession of a wife could only
be legally acquired by a temporary recognition of the pre-existing
communal rights.”[374]

Thus Herodotus states that, in Babylonia, every woman was obliged once
in her life to give herself up, in the temple of Mylitta, to strangers,
for the satisfaction of the goddess; and in some parts of Cyprus, he
tells us, the same custom prevailed.[375] In Armenia, according to
Strabo, there was a very similar law. The daughters of good families
were consecrated to Anaitis, a phallic divinity like Mylitta,
giving themselves, as it appears, to the worshippers of the goddess
indiscriminately.[376] Again, in the valleys of the Ganges, virgins
were compelled before marriage to offer themselves up in the temples
dedicated to Juggernaut. And the same is said to have been customary in
Pondicherry and at Goa.[377]

These practices, however, evidently belong to phallic-worship,
and occurred, as Mr. McLennan justly remarks, among peoples who
had advanced far beyond the primitive state. The farther back we
go, the less we find of such customs in India; “the germ only of
phallic-worship shows itself in the Vedas, and the gross luxuriance
of licentiousness, of which the cases referred to are examples, is of
later growth.”[378]

Ancient writers tell us that, among the Nasamonians and Augilæ,
two Libyan tribes, the _jus primae noctis_ was accorded to all the
guests at a marriage.[379] Garcilasso de la Vega asserts that, in
the province Manta in Peru, marriages took place on condition that
the bride should first yield herself to the relatives and friends of
the bridegroom.[380] In the Balearic Islands, according to Diodorous
Siculus, the bride was for one night considered the common property
of all the guests, after which she belonged exclusively to her
husband.[381] And v. Langsdorf reports the occurrence of a very similar
practice in Nukahiva.[382]

With regard to Sir J. Lubbock’s interpretation of these customs,
as acts of expiation for individual marriage, Mr. McLennan remarks
that they are not cases of privileges accorded to the men of the
bridegroom’s group only, which they should be, if they refer to an
ancient communal right.[383] It may also be noted that, in Nukahiva,
the license was dependent upon the will of the bride. Moreover, the
freedom granted to the wedding guests may be simply and naturally
explained. It may have been a part of the nuptial entertainment—a
horrible kind of hospitality, no doubt, but quite in accordance with
savage ideas, and analogous to another custom, which occurs much more
frequently; I mean the practice of lending wives.

Among many uncivilized peoples, it is customary for a man to offer his
wife, or one of his wives, to strangers for the time they stay in his
hut. Even this practice has been adduced by several writers as evidence
of a former communism.[384] To Sir John Lubbock it seems to involve the
recognition of “a right inherent in every member of the community, and
to visitors as temporary members.” Were this so, we should certainly
have to conclude that “communal marriage” has been very prevalent in
the human race, the practice of lending wives occurring among many
peoples in different parts of the world.[385] But it is difficult to
see how the practice could ever have been in any way connected with
communism in women for all men belonging to the same tribe. It is
not always the wife that is offered; it may as well be a daughter, a
sister, or a servant.[386] Thus the people of Madagascar warn strangers
to behave with decency to their wives, though they readily offer their
daughters;[387] and it is asserted that a Tungus “will give his
daughter for a time to any friend or traveller that he takes a liking
to,” and if he has no daughter, he will give his servant, but not his
wives.[388]

It can scarcely be doubted that such customs are due merely to savage
ideas of hospitality. When we are told that, among the coast tribes
of British Columbia, “the temporary present of a wife is one of the
greatest honours that can be shown there to a guest;”[389] or that
such an offer was considered by the Eskimo “as an act of generous
hospitality;”[390] or, that “this is the common custom when the
negroes wish to pay respect to their guests,”[391]—I cannot see why we
should look for a deeper meaning in these practices than that which
the words imply. A man offers a visitor his wife as he offers him a
seat at his table. It is the greatest honour a savage can show his
guest, as a temporary exchange of wives—a custom prevalent in North
America, Polynesia, and elsewhere[392]—is regarded as a seal of the
most intimate friendship. Hence, among the Greenlanders, those men
were reputed the best and noblest tempered, who, without any pain or
reluctance, would lend their friends their wives:[393] and the men of
Caindu, a region of Eastern Tibet, hoped by such an offering to obtain
the favour of the gods.[394] Indeed, if the practice of lending wives
is to be regarded as a relic of ancient communism in women, we may
equally well regard the practice of giving presents to friends, or
hospitality in other respects, as a remnant of ancient communism in
property of every kind.

The _jus primae noctis_ granted to the friends of the bridegroom may,
however, be derived from another source. Touching the capture of wives,
Mr. Brough Smyth states that, in New South Wales and about Riverina,
“in any instance where the abduction has taken place by a party of
men for the benefit of some one individual, each of the members of the
party claims, as a right, a privilege which the intended husband has
no power to refuse.”[395] A similar custom prevails, according to Mr.
Johnston, among the Wa-taïta in Eastern Central Africa, though the
capture here is a symbol only. After the girl has been bought by the
bridegroom, she runs away and affects to hide. Then she is sought out
by him and three or four of his friends. When she is found, the men
seize her and carry her off to the hut of her future husband, where she
is placed at the disposal of her captors.[396] In such cases the _jus
primae noctis_ is a reward for a good turn done, or perhaps, as Mr.
McLennan suggests,[397] a common war-right, exercised by the captors
of the woman. If we knew all the circumstances, this explanation
might prove to hold good also with regard to the right granted to the
wedding-guests in the cases we have mentioned. At any rate, it must
be admitted that these strange customs may be interpreted in a much
simpler way than that suggested by Sir John Lubbock.

There are some instances of _jus primae noctis_ accorded to
a particular person, a chief or a priest. Thus, among the
Kinipetu-Eskimo, the Ankut, or high-priest has this right.[398] Among
the Caribs, the bridegroom received his bride from the hand of the
Piache, or medicine-man, and certainly not as a virgin.[399] A similar
custom is met with among certain Brazilian tribes, though in some of
these cases it is to the chief that the right in question belongs.[400]
The Spanish nobleman Andagova states that, in Nicaragua, a priest
living in the temple was with the bride during the night preceding her
marriage.[401] And among the Tahus in Northern Mexico according to
Castañeda, the _droit du seigneur_ was accorded to the cacique.[402]

In descriptions of travel in the fifteenth century, the aboriginal
inhabitants of Teneriffe are represented as having married no woman who
had not previously spent a night with the chief, which was considered
a great honour.[403] The same right, according to Dr. Barth, was
presumably granted to the chief of Bagele in Adamáua;[404] and,
according to Herodotus, to the king of the ancient Adyrmachidae.[405]
Navarette tells us that, on the coast of Malabar, the bridegroom
brought the bride to the king, who kept her eight days in his palace;
and the man took it “as a great honour and favour that his king would
make use of her.”[406] Again, according to Hamilton, a Samorin could
not take his bride home for three nights, during which the chief priest
had a claim to her company.[407] Sugenheim believes even that, in
certain parts of France, a similar right was accorded to the higher
clergy during the Middle Ages.[408]

Yet Dr. Karl Schmidt has endeavoured, in a learned work, to prove that
the _droit du siegneur_ never existed in Europe, the later belief in it
being merely “ein gelehrter Aberglaube,” which arose in various ways.
Thus there was classical witness to ancient traditions of tyrants, who
had distinguished themselves by such proceedings as that right was
supposed to legalize. From various parts of the world came reports of
travellers as to tribes among whom defloration was the privilege or
duty of kings, priests, or other persons set apart for the purpose.
A grosser meaning than the words will warrant had, besides, in Dr.
Schmidt’s opinion, been attached to the fine paid by the vassal to
his feudal lord for permission to marry. That law, he says, which is
believed to have extended over a large part of Europe, has left no
evidence of its existence in laws, charters, decretals, trials, or
glossaries.[409]

This is not the proper place to discuss Dr. Schmidt’s hypothesis; but
his arguments do not seem to be conclusive.[410] Several writers speak
of estate-owners in Russia who claimed the _droit du seigneur_ in the
last and even the present century;[411] and a friend of mine informs me
that, when travelling in that country, he met with aged men whose wives
had been victims of the custom. It was certainly a privilege taken by
the law of might. But how in such cases shall we draw the line between
might and what is properly accepted as right?

Bachofen, Giraud-Teulon, Kulischer, and other writers[412] regard the
_jus primae noctis_ accorded to a special person, as a remnant of a
primitive state of promiscuity or “communal marriage.” It is, in
their opinion, a transformation of the ancient communal right, which
was taken away from the community and transferred to those who chiefly
represented it—the priest, the king, or the nobility.

But why may not the practice in question have been simply a consequence
of might? It may be a right taken forcibly by the stronger, or it
may be a privilege voluntarily given to the chief man as a mark of
esteem,—in either case, it depends upon his authority. Indeed, the
right of encroaching upon the marital rights of a subject is not
commonly restricted to the first night only. Where the chief or the
king has the power of life and death, what man can prohibit him from
doing his will? “Quite indisputed,” Dr. Holub says, with reference to
the Marutse, “is the king’s power to put to death, or to make a slave
of any one of his subjects in any way he choses; he may take a man’s
wife simply by providing him with another wife as a substitute.”[413]
In Dahomey, all women belong to the king, who causes every girl to
be brought to him before marriage, and, if he pleases, retains her
in the palace.[414] Among the Negroes in Fida, according to Bosman,
the captains of the king, who have to supply him with fresh wives,
immediately present to him any beautiful virgin they may see; and none
of his subjects dare presume to offer objections.[415] In Persia, it
was a legal principle that whatever was touched by the king remained
immaculate, and that he might go into the harem of any of his
subjects.[416] Among the Kukis, “all the women of the village, married
or single, are at the pleasure of the rajah,” who is regarded by his
people with almost superstitious veneration.[417] The Kalmuck priests,
who are not suffered to marry, may, it is said, pass a night with any
man’s wife, and this is esteemed a favour by the husband.[418] And
in Chamba (probably Cochin China), Marco Polo tells us, no woman was
allowed to marry until the king had seen her.[419]

According to Dr. Zimmermann, it is a dogma among many Malays that
the rajah has the entire disposal of the wives and children of his
subjects.[420] In New Zealand, when a chief desires to take to himself
a wife, he fixes his attention upon one and takes her, if need be by
force, without consulting her feelings and wishes, or those of any one
else.[421] In Tonga, the women of the lower people were at the disposal
of the chiefs, who even used to shoot the husbands, if they made
resistance;[422] whilst in Congo, as we are told by Mr. Reade, when the
king takes a fresh concubine, her husband and all her lovers are put to
death.[423]

In the interesting ‘Notes of a Country Clergyman’ in _Russkaja
Stariná_ (‘Russian Antiquity’), much light is thrown on the life of
Russian landlords before the emancipation of the serfs. Here is what is
said of one of them:—“Often N. I—tsch would stroll late in the evening
about his village to admire the prosperous condition of his peasants;
he would stop at some cottage, look in at the window, and tap on the
pane with his finger. This tapping was well known to everybody, and
in a moment the best-looking woman of the family went out to him....
Another landlord, whenever he visited his estate, demanded from the
manager, immediately after his arrival, a list of all the grown-up
girls. Then,” the author continues, “the master took to his service
each of the girls for three or four days, and as soon as the list was
finished, he went off to another village. This occurred regularly every
year.”[424]

Here we have a collection of facts, belonging, as I think, to the same
group as the _jus primae noctis_ is of a chief or a priest. And it is
obvious that they have nothing to do with “communal marriage.” The
privilege accorded to the priest, however, seems, in some cases, to
have a purely religious origin. Thus, Egede informs us that the native
women of Greenland thought themselves fortunate if an Angekokk, or
prophet, honoured them with his caresses; and some husbands even paid
him, because they believed that the child of such a holy man could not
but be happier and better than others.[425] Von Martius thinks that
the right granted to the medicine-man among the Brazilian aborigines
is owing to savage ideas of woman’s impurity.[426] And on the coast
of Malabar, Hamilton says, the bride was given to the chief priest,
“because the first fruits of her nuptials must be a holy oblation to
the god she worships.”[427]

       *       *       *       *       *

Yet another group of facts is adduced as evidence for the hypothesis of
ancient communism in women. Sir J. Lubbock and Professor Giraud-Teulon
cite some cases of courtesans being held in greater estimation than
women married to a single husband, or, at least, being by no means
despised.[428] Such feelings, Sir John believes, would naturally arise
“when the special wife was a stranger and a slave, while the communal
wife was a relative and a free woman,” and would, in some instances,
long survive the social condition to which they owed their origin.[429]
The courtesans are thus regarded as representatives of the communal
wives of primitive times. But it seems to me much more reasonable to
suppose that if, in Athens and India, courtesans were respected and
sought after even by the principal men, it was because they were the
only educated women.[430] Besides, as Mr. McLennan justly remarks with
regard to such “communal wives,” “if any inference is to be made from
their standing in Athens, in the brilliant age of Pericles, as to the
state of matters in the primitive groups, proof of primitive communism
in women might as well be sought in London or Paris in our own day. Far
back in the interval between savagery and the age of Pericles are the
heroes of Homer with their noble wedded wives.”[431]

It is true that, among some uncivilized peoples, women having many
gallants are esteemed better than virgins, and are more anxiously
desired in marriage. This is, for instance, stated to be the case with
the Indians of Quito,[432] the Laplanders in Regnard’s days,[433] and
the Hill Tribes of North Aracan.[434] But in each of these cases we
are expressly told that want of chastity is considered a merit in the
bride, because it is held to be the best testimony to the value of
her attractions. There are thus various reasons why courtesans and
licentious women may be held in respect and sought after, and we need
not, therefore, resort to Sir John Lubbock’s far-fetched hypothesis.




CHAPTER V

A CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY

(_Continued_)


We are indebted to Mr. Lewis H. Morgan for information as to the
names of various degrees of kinship among no fewer than 139 different
races or tribes. This collection shows that very many peoples have
a nomenclature of relationships quite different from our own. Mr.
Morgan divides the systems into two great classes, the descriptive
and the classificatory, which he regards as radically distinct. “The
first,” he says, “which is that of the Aryan, Semitic, and Uralian
families, rejecting the classification of kindred, except so far as
it is in accordance with the numerical system, describes collateral
consanguinei, for the most part, by an augmentation or combination of
the primary terms of relationship. These terms, which are those for
husband and wife, father and mother, brother and sister, and son and
daughter, to which must be added, in such languages as possess them,
grandfather and grandmother, and grandson and granddaughter, are thus
restricted to the primary sense in which they are here employed. All
other terms are secondary. Each relationship is thus made independent
and distinct from every other. But the second, which is that of the
Turanian, American Indian, and Malayan families, rejecting descriptive
phrases in every instance, and reducing consanguinei to great classes,
by a series of apparently arbitrary generalizations, applies the
same terms to all the members of the same class. It thus confounds
relationships, which, under the descriptive system, are distinct, and
enlarges the signification both of the primary and secondary terms
beyond their seemingly appropriate sense.”[435]

The most primitive form of the classificatory group is the system
of the “Malayan family,”[436] which prevails among the Hawaiians,
Kingsmill Islanders, Maoris, and, presumably, also among several
other Polynesian and Micronesian tribes.[437] According to this
system, all consanguinei, near and remote, are classified into five
categories. My brothers and sisters and my first, second, third, and
more remote male and female cousins, are the first category. To all
these without distinction I apply the same term. My father and mother,
together with their brothers and sisters, and their first, second, and
more remote cousins, are the second category. To all these without
distinction I apply likewise the same term. The brothers, sisters, and
several cousins of my grandparents I denominate as if they were my
grandparents; the cousins of my sons and daughters, as if they were
my sons and daughters; the grandchildren of my brothers and sisters
and their several cousins, as if they were my own grandchildren. All
the individuals of the same category address each other as if they
were brothers and sisters. Uncleship, auntship, and cousinship being
ignored, we have, as far as the nomenclature is considered, only
grandchildren.[438]

From this system of nomenclature all the others belonging to the
classificatory group have, according to Mr. Morgan, been gradually
developed. The system of the Two-Mountain Iroquois differs from that
of the Hawaiians essentially in two respects only, the mother’s
brother being distinguished by a special term, and so also a sister’s
children. The Micmac system is somewhat more advanced. Not only does
a man call his sister’s son his nephew, but a woman applies the same
term to her brother’s son; and not only is a mother’s brother termed
an uncle, but also the father’s sister is distinguished by a special
term, as an aunt. A father’s brother is called a “little father;”
and a mother’s sister, a “little mother.” Still more advanced is the
system of the Wyandots, which may be regarded as the typical system of
the Indians.[439] A mother’s brother’s son and a father’s sister’s son
are no longer called by the same terms as brothers, but are recognized
as cousins; and women apply to their mother’s brother’s grandsons no
longer the same term as to their sons, but call them nephews.

It is needless to enter into further details. Those who shrink from
the trouble of reading through Mr. Morgan’s extensive tables, will
find an excellent summary of them in the fifth chapter of Sir John
Lubbock’s great work on ‘The Origin of Civilization.’ It may, however,
be added that the most advanced system of the classificatory group is
that of the Karens and Eskimo, which differs from our own in three
respects only. The children of cousins are termed nephews; the children
of nephews, grandchildren; and a grandfather’s brothers and sisters,
respectively, grandfathers and grandmothers. “Hence,” says Sir John
Lubbock, “though the Karens and Eskimo have now a far more correct
system of nomenclature than that of many other races, we find, even in
this, clear traces of a time when these peoples had not advanced in
this respect beyond the lowest stage.”[440]

From these systems of nomenclature Mr. Morgan draws very far-reaching
conclusions, assuming that they are necessarily to be explained by
early marriage customs. Thus, from the “Malayan system,” he infers
the former prevalence of “marriage in a group” of all brothers
and sisters and cousins of the same grade or generation; or, more
correctly, his case is, that if we can explain the “Malayan system”
on the assumption that such a general custom once existed, then we
must believe that it did formerly exist. “Without this custom,” he
says, “it is impossible to explain the origin of the system from the
nature of descents. There is, therefore, a necessity for the prevalence
of this custom amongst the remote ancestors of all the nations which
now possess the classificatory system, if the system itself is to
be regarded as having a natural origin.”[441] The family resulting
from this custom he calls, in his latest work, the “consanguine
family,” and in this, consisting of a body of kinsfolk, within which
there prevailed promiscuity, or “communal marriage,” between all men
and women of the same generation, the family in its first stage is
recognized.[442] Mr. Morgan believes, however, that as a necessary
condition antecedent to this form of the family, promiscuity, in a
wider sense of the term, may be theoretically deduced, though, as he
says, “it lies concealed in the misty antiquity of mankind beyond the
reach of positive knowledge.”[443]

It is needless here to consider whether the last conclusion holds good.
I shall endeavour to prove that Mr. Morgan’s inference of a stage of
promiscuous intercourse even within the prescribed limits is altogether
untenable. All depends on the point whether the “classificatory
system” is a system of blood-ties, the nomenclature having been founded
on blood-relationship, as near as the parentage of individuals could be
known. Mr. Morgan assumes this, instead of proving it.

Yet in the terms themselves there is, generally, nothing which
indicates that they imply an idea of consanguinity. Professor Buschmann
has given us a very interesting list of the names for father and
mother in many different languages.[444] The similarity of the terms
is striking. “Pa,” “papa,” or “baba,” for instance, means father in
several languages of the Old and New World, and “ma,” “mama,” means
mother. The Tupis in Brazil have “paia” for father, and “maia” for
mother;[445] the Uaraguaçú, respectively, “paptko” and “mamko.”[446]
In other languages the terms for father are “ab,” “aba,” “apa,”
“ada,” “ata,” “tata”; those for mother, “ama,” “emä,” “ana,”
“ena,” &c. According to Buschmann, there are four typical forms of
words for each of these ideas: for father, “pa,” “ta,” “ap,” “at”;
for mother, “ma,” “na,” “am,” “an.” Sometimes, however, the meaning
of the types is reversed. Thus, in Georgian,[447] as well as in the
Mahaga language of Ysabel,[448] “mama” stands for father; whilst the
Tuluvas in Southern India call the father “amme,” and the mother
“appe.”[449]

The terms used often fall outside of the types mentioned. In the Lifu
tongue, for example, one term for father is “kaka;”[450] in the Duauru
language of Baladea, “chicha”;[451] in the Maréan tongue, “chacha”
or “cheche.”[452] Again, among the Chalcha Mongols and some related
peoples, mother is “ekè.”[453] In the Kanúri language, of Central
Africa, the mother is called “ya”;[454] while the Kechua in Brazil
call the father “yaya.”[455] Among the Bakongo, as I am informed by
Mr. Ingham, “se” means father; in Finnish, “isä.” Again, by the
Brazilian Bakaĭri, the mother is called “ise”;[456] and, by the people
of Aneiteum, New Hebrides, “risi.”[457]

Similar terms are often used for other relationships. The Greek,
“πάππος” signifies grandfather, and “μάμμα” grandmother. In the
Kanúri language, “yaya” stands for elder brother;[458] and, in
Lifuan, “mama” and “dhina” are terms for brother, whilst mother is
“thine.”[459]

The origin of such terms is obvious. They are formed from the easiest
sounds a child can produce. “‘Pa-pa,’ ‘ma-ma,‘ 'tata,’ and
‘apa,’ ‘ama,’ ‘ata,’” Professor Preyer says, “emerge originally
spontaneously, the way of the breath being barred at the expiration,
either by the lips (_p_, _m_), or by the tongue (_d_, _t_).”[460]
Yet the different races vary considerably with regard to the ease
with which they produce certain sounds. Thus the pronunciation of the
labials is very difficult to many Indians,[461] on account of which
their terms for father, mother, or other near kinsfolk, often differ
much from the types given by Professor Buschmann.

It is evident that the terms borrowed from the children’s lips have
no intrinsic meaning whatever. Hence, if a Bakaĭri child calls its
father and father’s brother “tsogo,” its mother and mother’s sister
“tsego”;[462] if a Macúsi names his paternal uncle “papa” as well as
his father, and an Efatese names his father and all the tribe brothers
of his father “ava” or “tama”;[463] if the Dacotahs apply the term
“ahta” not only to the father, but also to the father’s brother, to
the mother’s sister’s husband, to the father’s father’s brother’s son,
&c., and the term “enah” not only to the mother, but also to the
mother’s sister, to the mother’s mother’s sister’s daughter, &c.;[464]
if, among the New Caledonians, an uncle, taking the place of a father,
is called “baba” like the father himself, and an aunt is called
“gnagna” like a mother;[465] if, as Archdeacon Hodgson of Zanzibar,
writes to me, a native of Eastern Central Africa uses the words “baba”
and “mama” not only for father and mother respectively, but also, very
commonly, for “any near relationship or even external connection;” if,
finally, the Semitic word for father, “ab” (“abu”), is not only used
in a wide range of senses, but, to quote Professor Robertson Smith,
“in all dialects is used in senses quite inconsistent with the idea
that procreator is the radical meaning of the word,”[466]—we certainly
must not, from these designations, infer anything as to early marriage
customs.

Of course there are other terms applied to kinsfolk besides words
taken from the lips of children, or words derived from these. But
though considerable, their number has been somewhat exaggerated.
Thus, for instance, Professor Vámbéry, in his work upon the primitive
culture of the Turko-Tartars, says that the terms for mother, “ana”
or “ene” have originally the meaning of woman or nurse, being derived
from the roots “an” and “en.”[467] Exactly the reverse seems to be
the fact, the terms for mother being the primitive words. In the same
way, I cannot but think that Professor Max Müller and several other
philologists are in error in deriving “pitár,” “pater,” “father,”
from the root “pa,” which means to protect, to nourish; and “mâtár,”
“mater,” “mother,” from the root “ma,” to fashion.[468] It seems,
indeed, far more natural, as has been pointed out by Sir J. Lubbock
and others, that the roots “pa,” to protect, and “ma,” to fashion,
come from “pa,” father, and “ma,” mother, and not _vice versa_.[469]
I am the more inclined to accept this explanation, as Mr. A. J. Swann
informs me, from Kavala Island, Lake Tanganyika, that among the Waguha,
the words “baba,” and “tata,” which mean father, also have the
meaning of protector, provider.

I do not deny that relationships—especially in the collateral and
descending lines—are in some cases denoted by terms derived from roots
having an independent meaning; but the number of those that imply an
idea of consanguinity does not seem to be very great. Mr. Bridges
writes that, among the Yahgans, “the names ‘imu’ and ‘dabi’—father and
mother—have no meaning apart from their application, neither have any
of their other very definite and ample list of terms for relatives,
except the terms ‘macu’ and ‘macipa’ son and daughter. These terms
refer to ‘magu’ which means parturition; ‘cipa’ (‘keepa’) signifies
woman or female.” In Bakongo, according to Mr. Ingham, “se” and
“tata” denote father; “mama,” “mbuta,” and “ngudi,” mother;
“nfumu,” elder brother or sister; “mbunzi,” younger brother; and
“mbusi,” younger sister. “Nfumu” means also Sir, chief; “mbuta”
means “the one who bore,” from “buta,” or “wuta,” to beget; and
“ngudi,” “the one we descended from.” Again, Mr. Radfield informs
me that, in the language of Lifu, the term for father means root;
the term for mother, foundation or vessel; the term for sister,
forbidden or “not to be touched;” and the terms for eldest and younger
brother, respectively, ruler and ruled. It is possible—I should even
say probable—that, in these instances also, the designations for
relationships are the radical words. Besides, it should be observed
that, in Yahgan, “the terms for relatives are strictly reserved for
such, neither are they interchanged,” and that in Bakongo, the terms
“tata” and “mama” are used as signs of respect to any one, whilst
the terms “mbuta” and “ngudi” seem to be applied exclusively to the
mother.

Not only has Mr. Morgan given no evidence for the truth of his
assumption that the “classificatory system” is a system of blood-ties,
but this assumption is not even fully consistent with the facts he
has himself stated. It is conceivable that uncertainty as regards
fatherhood might have led a savage to call several men his fathers, but
an analogous reason could never have induced him to name several women
his mothers. Hence, if a man applies the same term to his mother’s
sisters as to his mother, and he himself is addressed as a son by a
woman who did not give birth to him, this evidently shows that the
nomenclature, at least in certain cases, cannot be explained by the
nature of descent.[470]

There can be scarcely any doubt that the terms for relationships are,
in their origin, terms of address. “The American Indians,” says
Mr. Morgan, “always speak to each other, when related, by the term
of relationship, and never by the personal name of the individual
addressed.”[471] From a psychological point of view, it would, indeed,
be surprising if it could be shown that primitive men, in addressing
all the different members of their family or tribe, took into
consideration so complicated a matter as the degree of consanguinity.
Can we really believe that a savage whose intelligence, perhaps, was so
deficient that he was scarcely able to count his own fingers, applied
the same term to his cousins as to his brothers, because he was not
certain whether, after all, they were not his brothers and that, when
he did make a distinction between them, he did so _because_ they were
begotten by different fathers? Facts show that savages generally
denominate their kindred according to much simpler principles, the
names being given chiefly with reference to sex and age, as also to the
external or social, relationship in which the speaker stands to the
person whom he addresses.

In every language there are different designations for persons of
different sexes. In the rudest system of nomenclature, the Hawaiian,
father and other kinsmen of the same generation are called “makua
kana;” mother, mother’s sisters, father’s sisters, &c., “makua
waheena,” “kana” and “waheena” being the terms for male and female.
A son is called “kaikee kana,” a daughter “kaikee waheena,” whilst
“kana” alone is applied to husband, husband’s brother, and sister’s
husband, and “waheena” to wife, wife’s sister, brother’s wife, &c.

There are also separate terms in every language for relations belonging
to different generations. Among the lower races especially, age, or,
more exactly, the age of the person spoken to compared with that of the
speaker, plays a very important part in the matter of denomination.
According to Dr. Davy, the Veddahs appear to be without names; “a
Veddah interrogated on the subject, said, ‘I am called a man: when
young, I was called the little man: and when old, I shall be called
the old man.’”[472] The Hawaiians, as we are informed by Judge
Andrews, have no definite general word for brother in common use. But
“kaikuaána” signifies any one of my brothers, or male cousins, older
than myself, I being a male, and any one of my sisters, or female
cousins, older than myself, I being a female; whilst “kaikaina”
signifies a younger brother of a brother, or a younger sister of a
sister.[473] Such distinguishing epithets applied to older and younger
are, in fact, very frequently met with among uncivilized peoples. Thus,
touching the Andamanese, Mr. Man states that “brothers and sisters
speak of one another by titles that indicate relative age: that is,
their words for brother and sister involve the distinction of elder or
younger.” A like system is adopted by them in respect to half-brothers,
half-sisters, cousins, brothers-in-law, and sisters-in-law.[474] In
certain languages, too, there are special terms for an uncle on the
father’s side older than the father, and for an uncle younger than
he;[475] and in the Fulfúlde tongue, the age of the uncles is so
minutely specified, that the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth
uncle, on both the father’s and the mother’s side, are each called by a
particular name.[476]

The wider meaning in which many terms for kinship are used bear witness
in the same direction. The Rev. J. Sibree states that, in Hova, “ray,”
father, does not take the sense the corresponding word in many Semitic
languages has, of “maker” of a thing, but it is used in a wide sense
as an elder or superior; and “rény,” mother, is also used in a
wide sense as a respectful way of addressing an elderly woman.[477]
Mr. Swann writes to me that, among the Waguha, West Tanganyika, men
advanced in years are termed “baba,” father, whilst, in other parts
of Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Reade, old men are addressed as
“rera,” father, and old women as “ngwe,” mother.[478] The Russian
“batushka” and “matushka,” as also the Swedish “far” and “mor,”
are often used in a similar way. Again, Mr. Cousins asserts that,
among the natives of Cis-Natalian Kafirland, the terms for father,
mother, brother, and sister, are not restricted to them only, but are
applied equally to other persons of a similar age, whether related
or otherwise. “‘Bawo,’ father,” he says, “means elder or older,
‘bawo-kulu’ means a big-father, one older than father.” Probably
“bawo,” as belonging to the type “pa,” was originally used as a
term of address, from which the sense of elder or older was derived;
but this does not interfere with the matter in question. The Rev. E.
Casalis, writing of the Basutos, states that “in addressing a person
older than one’s self, one says, ‘My father, my mother;’ to an equal,
‘My brother;’ and to inferiors, ‘My children.’”[479] The Finnish
“isä” and the Votyak “ai,” father, the Lappish “Aja,” and the
Esthonian “äi,” grandfather, are evidently related to, and probably
the roots of, the Finnish “iso” and “äijä” which mean big.[480] The
Chukchi use, besides “atta” for father and “mámang” for mother,
“empynátchyo” and “émpyngau” respectively, which obviously have the
same root as “émpytchin,” elder or older.[481] The Brazilian Uainumá
call a father “paii,” but also “pechyry,” _i.e._, old.[482] “Les
jeunes Australiens,” says Bishop Salvado, “ont coutume d’appeler
‘mama’ ou ‘maman’ (c’est-à-dire-père) tous les vieillards, comme
aussi ‘N-angan’ (ou mère) les femmes avancées en âge.”[483] According
to Nicolaus Damascenus, the Galactophagi denominated “all old men
fathers; young men, sons; and those of equal age, brothers.”[484] In
German, the parents are “die Eltern,” the older (“die Aelteren”),
and they are also called familiarly “die Alten;” the father, “der
Alte;” and the mother, “die Alte” or “Altsche.”[485] Again, among
the North American Indians, old people are very commonly named
grandfathers and grandmothers;[486] whilst the Finnish “ämmä” does
not signify grandmother only, but old woman in general.[487] Among the
Tsuishikari Ainos, the maternal grandfather and grandmother of a child
are called both by _him_, and his _father_, “henki” and “unarabe”
respectively.[488]

As to the collateral line, it should be observed that, in Ćagatai, an
elder sister is called “egeći,” which actually means old woman “ege,”
old, big; “eći,” woman, sister.[489] In Hungarian, where “bátya”
stands for elder brother, an uncle is “nagybátya,” _i.e._, a big elder
brother.[490] Among many Ural-Altaic peoples, the same term is applied
to an elder brother as to an uncle, to an elder sister as to an
aunt.[491] Were we to follow Mr. Morgan’s way of reasoning, we should,
from this nomenclature, come to very curious conclusions as to the
early marriage customs of the peoples in question.

Again, in the Galibi language of Brazil, “tigami” signifies young
brother, son, and little child indiscriminately;[492] and several
languages have no other words for son and daughter than those for lad
and girl.[493] Thus, in Hawaiian, a son is called male child, or more
properly, little male; and a daughter, female child or girl.[494] Mr.
George Bridgman states that, among the Mackay blacks of Queensland, the
word for daughter is used by a man for any young woman belonging to
the class which his daughter would belong to if he had one.[495] And,
speaking of the South Australians, Eyre says, “In their intercourse
with each other, natives of different tribes are exceedingly
punctilious and polite; ... almost everything that is said is prefaced
by the appellation of father, son, brother, mother, sister, or some
other similar term, corresponding to that degree of relationship
which would have been most in accordance with their relative ages and
circumstances.”[496]

All those names, refer, as previously mentioned, not to the absolute,
but to the relative, age of the person addressed. Often, too, there is
a certain relativity in the use of words denominating sex. Mr. Dall
remarks, for instance, that among the Eskimo, the form of the terms
of relationship “appears to depend in some cases more on the sex of
the speaker than on that of the person to whom the term refers.” In
Eastern Central Africa, “if a man have a brother and a sister, he is
called one thing by the brother, but quite a different thing by the
sister.”[497] And several other instances of the same kind are to be
found in Mr. Morgan’s tables.

As for the third factor influencing the terms of address—_i.e._, the
social relationship which exists between the addresser and the one
addressed,—it is obvious that different designations are applied to
enemies and friends, to strangers and members of the family-circle,
nay, generally, to persons to whom one stands in an altogether
different external relationship. The importance of this factor is
evident from several statements. Thus, among the Hovas, according to
Mr. Sibree, the words for brother and sister “are also used widely
for any person whom one meets and desires to act towards in a friendly
manner.”[498] The Fuegians says Mr. Bridges, form certain kinds of
friendships, and “speak of aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, cousins,
nieces and nephews, &c., which are only so through the friendships
established.”[499] Among the Waguha, strangers are called “ndugu,”
brother, if of the same tribe;[500] and Mr. Hartshorne tells us that
the Veddahs applied to him the term “hura,” or cousin.[501] We
can understand, then, why the same name, as a rule, is used by the
savage to denote just the persons of the same sex and of like age
who belong to his own family-circle; and why, as a consequence, the
nomenclature is rich or poor according as that circle is small or
large. The Yahgans, for instance, who live in families rather than in
tribes, have a very definite list of terms for kinsfolk. They have
different appellations for nephews and nieces on the brother’s side,
and nephews and nieces on the sister’s side, and their words for
uncle and aunt differ according as this relationship is paternal or
maternal. They have also special terms for father-, mother-, son-and
daughter-, brother-and sister-in-law.[502] On the other hand, the
larger, the body of kinsfolk that keep closely together, and the less
it is differentiated, as regards the functions of its various members,
the more comprehensive are generally the terms of address. The
“classificatory system of relationship” must, therefore, have emerged
at a time when the separate families had already united in larger
bodies.

The same principle explains how it happens that a maternal uncle is
almost always distinguished from a father by a separate term, whilst
this is not the case with an uncle on the father’s side, the former
generally living in another community from his nephew, and, besides,
very frequently standing to him in a quite peculiar relationship
through the rules of succession. It may be fairly assumed, too, that
a mother’s sister much oftener than a father’s sister is called a
mother, because sisters, among savages, keep as a rule, far more
closely together, when married, than brothers and sisters; sometimes
even, especially among the North American Indians, they are the wives
of the same man. If we add to this that a father’s brother’s son and
a mother’s sister’s son are more commonly addressed as brothers than
as father’s sister’s son and a mother’s brother’s son, it becomes
obvious to how great an extent the nomenclature is influenced by
external relations. But as a certain kind of external relationship is
invariably connected with a certain degree, or certain degrees, of
blood-relationship, the designations given with reference to the former
have been taken as terms for the latter.

The basis on which Mr. Morgan has built his hypothesis must be
considered, then, altogether untenable.[503] It cannot be proved
that, where the “classificatory system” prevails, the nomenclature
was intended to express the degree of consanguity so exactly as
he assumes, or that it had originally anything whatever to do with
descent. On the contrary, I have endeavoured to show that the case
was probably just the reverse; so that no inference regarding early
marriage customs is to be drawn from the terms for relationships. Even
now, in Spanish, a brother’s great-grandson is called grandson; in
Bulgarian, as also in Russian, a father’s father’s brother is termed a
grandfather, and a father’s father’s sister a grandmother; the Greek
“ἁνεψιός” appears to have been applied to a nephew, a grandson, and a
cousin; “neef,” in Dutch, still expresses these three relationships
indiscriminately; in Flemish and Platt Deutsch, “nichte” is applied
to a female cousin as well as to a niece; and Shakspeare, in his will,
describes his granddaughter, Susannah Hall, as “my niece.”[504]
Surely, nobody would look upon these designations as relics of ancient
times, when there really might have been some uncertainty as to kinship
in the direction which the terms indicate. Mr. Morgan himself admits
that, in Latin, “nepos” did not originally signify “either a nephew,
grandson or cousin, but that it was used promiscuously to designate a
class of persons next without the primary relationships.”[505]

       *       *       *       *       *

Thirty years ago, in a work of prodigious learning,[506] the Swiss
jurist, Dr. Bachofen, drew attention to the remarkable fact that a
system of “kinship through mothers only” prevailed among several
ancient peoples. Moreover, partly from actual statements of old
writers, partly from traditions and myths, he came to the conclusion
that such a system everywhere preceded the rise of “kinship through
males.” A few years later, though quite independently of him, Mr.
McLennan set forth exactly the same hypothesis, being led to it
chiefly by extensive studies in modern ethnology. While, however,
Bachofen explained the phenomenon as a consequence of the supremacy
of women, Mr. McLennan regarded it as due to the uncertain paternity
which resulted from early promiscuity. “It is inconceivable,” he
says, “that anything but the want of certainty on that point could
have long prevented the acknowledgment of kinship through males; and
in such cases we shall be able to conclude that such certainty has
formerly been wanting—that more or less promiscuous intercourse between
the sexes has formerly prevailed. The connection between these two
things—uncertain paternity and kinship through females only, seems so
necessary—that of cause and effect—that we may confidently infer the
one where we find the other.”[507]

It must be observed that the facts adduced as examples of what Mr.
McLennan calls “kinship through females only” in most instances imply,
chiefly, that children are named after their mothers, not after their
fathers, and that property and rank succeed exclusively in the female
line. If these customs were to be explained as relics of ancient
promiscuity, we certainly should have to admit that such a state was
formerly very prevalent in the human race. Yet we could not be sure
that it prevailed universally. For, though the number of peoples among
whom descent and inheritance follow the mother’s side only, is very
considerable,[508] the number of those among whom the male line is
recognized, is scarcely less—even apart from the civilized nations
of Europe and Asia. At present, when anthropologists affirm with so
much assurance that a system of exclusive “kinship through females”
prevailed everywhere before the tie of blood between father and child
had found a place in systems of relationships, it seems appropriate to
give a list of peoples among whom such a system does _not_ prevail—a
list, however, which cannot pretend to completeness.

Starting, then, with North America, which is acknowledged to be, or to
have been, one of the chief centres of “mother-right,” or metrocracy,
we meet there with many aboriginal nations among whom a son, as a rule
takes the father’s name and becomes his heir.[509] Thus Cranz states
that, among the Eskimo of Greenland, “when a husband dies, his eldest
son inherits his house, tent, and woman’s boat, and besides must
maintain the mother and children, who share the furniture and clothes
amongst themselves.”[510] Among the Indians bordering on the south-east
coast of the river St. Lawrence, according to Heriot, the eldest son
took the name of his father with the addition of one syllable.[511] The
Californian tribes[512] and the Dacotahs[513] recognized chieftainship
as hereditary in the male line; and, with reference to the latter,
Mr. Prescott remarks that they cannot well forget relationships, as
the names of father and mother are both recollected for three or four
generations.[514] Among the Ahts, the eldest son takes all the property
left by his father, and the head-chiefs rank is hereditary in the male
line.[515] The paternal system prevails, moreover, in thirteen other
tribes mentioned by Mr. Frazer in his essay on “Totemism.”[516]

In Mexico, Yucatan, San Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, succession
ran from father to son; and in Vera Paz, according to Las Casas,
kinship was so exclusively recognized in the male line, that the people
there thought the most remote kin in their own lineage to be more
closely related than the daughter of their mother, provided she was
not of the same father. On the other hand, Piedrahita tells us that,
among the Chibchas, the sons of sisters, and, in default of such, the
brothers of the king, were the heirs to the crown of Bogota, but that
the sons had a right to the personal property of their father; whilst,
according to Herrera, the property was inherited by the brothers, and
if there were none living, by the _sons_ of those who were dead.[517]

Among the Caribs, kinship was reckoned in the female line, but the
authority of the chiefs was hereditary in the male line only, the
children of sisters being excluded from the succession.[518] Among
the Macas Indians in Ecuador, property descends from father to
son;[519] among the Guaycurûs, Abipones, and Araucanians, nobility, or
chieftainship, was hereditary in the male line;[520] and the Brazilian
aborigines, or at least some of them, laid particular stress upon
kinship through fathers.[521] Again, with reference to the Yahgans of
Tierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges writes, “A child belongs equally to the
clan of its father and mother as regards duty of revenge, but is always
reckoned a member of the father’s clan only. Children are generally
named after their grandparents, paternal or maternal indifferently.
They are quite as much attached to their mother’s relatives and these
to them, as to their paternal relatives; the only difference is that
they are integral parts of the father’s clan, not of the mother’s.”
Speaking of the same people, M. Hyades remarks, “L’héritage se
transmet à l’époux survivant, ou à défaut, au fils aîné.”[522] In
short, the paternal system, so far as we know, predominates among the
aborigines of South America.

Passing to the Pacific Islands, we find that, though rank and clan
are commonly inherited there through the mother, property generally
goes in the male line. In Tonga, the son succeeds his father in homage
and title,[523] and here, as well as in Fiji, on the father’s death,
his possessions descend to his children.[524] Ellis tells us that, in
Tahiti, the child of a chief was invested, soon after its birth, with
the name and office of its father,[525] and in the case of there being
no children, the brother of the deceased assumed the government. In
other families property always went to the eldest son.[526] Among the
Hawaiians, the rank of the principal and inferior chiefs, the offices
of the priests, as also other situations of honour and influence,
descended from father to son,[527] although on the whole, the female
line predominated.[528] In the Hervey Islands, children belonged either
to the father’s or mother’s clan, according to arrangement; usually,
however, the father had the preference.[529] In New Caledonia, kinship
is reckoned in the male line,[530] and in Lifu, as Mr. Radfield informs
me, children belong to the paternal clan. In the Caroline Group, landed
property succeeds mostly from father to son, children are named after
their father’s father or mother’s father, and, apparently, the rank of
the father influences that of the son, at least if he be a chief.[531]
Among the Rejangs[532] and Bataks[533] of Sumatra, as also in several
other islands belonging to the Indian Archipelago,[534] and in New
Guinea,[535] the male line prevails. In the Kingsmill Islands, “if a
chief has several children by different wives, the son of the mother of
the highest rank is the successor.”[536] And, in New Zealand, nobility
was inherited both in the male and female line; but on the death of
a man, his eldest son took the family name which his father had held
before him.[537]

Australian children are generally named after their mother’s clan; but
this is not the case in every tribe.[538] Among the Gournditch-mara,
Turra, Moncalon, Torndirrup, and some other tribes, the male line
prevails.[539] With reference to the Narrinyeri, the Rev. G. Taplin
states that a man’s children belong to his tribe (_i.e._ clan), and
not to their mother’s; that property descends from father to son, and
that, in case of a man dying without issue of his own, his possessions
are always transmitted to the brother’s children.[540] Again, in the
Dieyerie tribe of South Australia, the sons take the father’s clan, the
daughters the mother’s.[541] Even where children are named after their
mother, inheritance may go from father to son. Thus, among the West
Australians, the hunting ground or landed property descends in the male
line, though “children of either sex always take the family name of
their mother.”[542]

Among the Todas, all children belong to the father’s family, and
inheritance runs through males only.[543] The same is the case with
most of the Indian Hill Tribes: either all the sons dividing their
father’s property equally, as among the Gonds, Bodo, and Dhimáls; or
the eldest son getting the largest share, as among the Kandhs, Karens,
and Nagas; or the youngest born male being the only heir, as among
the Hos; or the favourite son succeeding without reference to age,
as among the Mishmis.[544] Among the Pahárias, too, sons inherit,
and nephews by sisters get no share.[545] The law of succession
among the Singphos gives to the eldest son all the landed property
of the father, to the youngest all his personal property, while the
rest inherit nothing.[546] Among the Santals, children belong to the
father’s clan;[547] and the same is the case with the offspring of
intermarriages of Lepchas and Limbus and Butias.[548] Touching the
Karens, Dr. A. Bunker writes to me, “A child takes a name of its
own, and of neither of the parents; but usually the father, being the
stronger, takes the child in case of separation. It is regarded as
belonging to both parents, so far as blood goes.” If we add to this
that the male line prevails in Arabia,[549] Tibet,[550] throughout
Russian Asia,[551] and among the Ainos,[552] it must be admitted
that the system of “kinship through females only” is of very rare
occurrence in Asia, being restricted, so far as I know, to a few parts
of India, Ceylon, and the Malay Archipelago.[553]

It is much more prevalent among the African races. Yet, even among
them, there are many instances where succession runs in the male line.
A king or chief of the Somals[554] and Ba-kwileh[555] is succeeded by
his son. Among the Fulah, this dignity is transmitted to the brother,
while, in other instances, succession goes from father to son.[556]
Among the Negroes of the Gold Coast, according to Bosman, the eldest
son succeeded his father in office, though kinship was reckoned through
the mother all along this coast, except at Accra.[557] Dr. A. Sims
writes that, among the Bateke, “the child is considered as belonging
to the father and mother equally,” and takes the grandfather’s or
grandmother’s name. Among the Waguha, according to Mr. Swann, children
are generally named after the father. In Lánda, the eldest son inherits
all his father’s possessions, wives included.[558] Among the Damaras,
whose divisions into clans are derived from the mother, the eldest son
of the chief wife, nevertheless, is the successor of his father;[559]
and the same rule prevails among the Bechuanas.[560] The Rev. A.
Eyles states that all Zulu children belong to the father’s tribe, and
are called by his name or by the name of some of his ancestors.[561]
According to Mr. Cousins,[562] this is essentially true of various
Kafir tribes, the first son, however, never being named after the
grandfather, but always after the father. Warner, Brownlee, and E. 
v. Weber assert also that, among the people, inheritance passes
from father to son.[563] Le Vaillant and Kolben state the same with
reference to the Hottentots and Bushmans;[564] and Andersson affirms
that, among the Namaquas, daughters take the father’s name, sons the
mother’s.[565] Finally, in the part of Madagascar where Drury was,
kinship does not seem to have been, in every case, reckoned through the
female, though in that island children generally follow the condition
of the mother.[566]

As for ancient peoples, Bachofen has adduced from the works of
classical writers evidence for the uterine line having prevailed among
several of them. But, to quote Sir Henry Maine, “the greatest races
of mankind, when they first appear to us, show themselves at or near
a stage of development in which relationship or kinship is reckoned
exclusively through males.”[567] Several writers have, it is true,
endeavoured to prove that, among the primitive Aryans, descent was
traced through females only;[568] but the evidence does not seem to be
conclusive. Much importance has been attributed to the specially close
connection which, according to Tacitus, existed between a sister’s
children and their mother’s brothers;[569] but Dr. Schrader observes
that, in spite of this prominent position of the maternal uncle in
the ancient Teutonic family, the _patruus_ distinctly came before
the _avunculus_, the agnates before the cognates, in testamentary
succession. He also suggests that, when the head of a household died,
the women of his family passed under the guardianship of the eldest
son, and that a woman’s children had therefore, quite naturally, a
peculiarly intimate relation to their maternal uncle.[570] It is safe
to say with Professor Max Müller, that we can neither assert nor deny
that in unknown times the Aryans ever passed through a metrocratic
stage.[571]

Even if it could be proved—which is doubtful—that, in former times, a
system of “kinship through females only,” fully developed, prevailed
among all the peoples whose children take the mother’s name and are
considered to belong to her clan, though succession runs in the male
line, we should still have to account for the fact that a large number
of peoples exhibit no traces of such a system.[572] And to them belong
many of the rudest races of the world—such as the aborigines of Brazil,
the Fuegians, Hottentots, Bushmans, and several very low tribes in
Australia and India. The inference that “kinship through females only”
has everywhere preceded the rise of “kinship through males,” would,
then, be warranted only on condition that the cause, or the causes, to
which the maternal system is owing, could be proved to have operated
universally in the past life of mankind. From Mr. McLennan’s point of
view, such an inference would be inadmissible, as he cannot prove the
former occurrence of a universal stage of promiscuity or polyandry,
leading to uncertain paternity—the cause to which he attributes that
system.

Yet it is far from being so inconceivable as Mr. McLennan assumes,
that “anything but the want of certainty on that point could have
long prevented the acknowledgment of kinship through males.”[573]
Paternity, as Sir Henry Maine remarks, is “matter of inference, as
opposed to maternity, which is matter of observation.”[574] Hence it
is almost beyond doubt that the father’s participation in parentage
was not recognized as soon as the mother’s.[575] Now, however, there
does not seem to be a single people which has not made the discovery
of fatherhood. In reply to my question whether the Fuegians consider
a child to descend exclusively or predominantly from either of the
parents, Mr. Bridges certainly writes that, according to his idea, they
“consider the maternal tie much more important than the paternal, and
the duties connected with it of mutual help, defence, and vengeance
are held very sacred.” But it is doubtful whether this refers to the
mere physiological connection between the child and its parents. Dr.
Sims informs me that, among the Bateke, the function of both parents in
generation is held alike important, and the Waguha of West Tanganyika,
as Mr. Swann states, also recognize the part taken by both. The same
is asserted by Archdeacon Hodgson concerning certain other tribes of
Eastern Central Africa, though, among them, children take the name of
the mother’s tribe. Again, the Naudowessies, according to Carver, had
the very curious idea that their offspring were indebted to their
father for their souls, the invisible part of their essence, and to the
mother for their corporeal and visible part; hence they considered it
“more rational that they should be distinguished by the name of the
latter, from whom they indubitably derive their being, than by that of
the father, to which a doubt might sometimes arise whether they are
justly entitled.”[576] Moreover, it seems as if the father’s share in
parentage, once discovered, was often exaggerated. Thus, referring to
some tribes of New South Wales, Mr. Cameron tells us that, although
the father has nothing to do with the disposal of his daughter, as she
belongs to the clan of her mother’s brother, they “believe that the
daughter emanates from her father solely, being only nutured by her
mother.”[577] Indeed, Mr. Howitt has found in every Australian tribe,
without exception, with which he has acquaintance, the idea that the
child is derived from the male parent only. As a black fellow once put
it to him, “The man gives the child to a woman to take care of for
him, and he can do whatever he likes with his own child.”[578] Again,
Mr. Cousins writes that, according to Kaffir ideas, a child descends
chiefly, though not exclusively, from the father; and the ancient
Greeks, as well as the Egyptians[579] and Hindus,[580] maintained a
similar view. Nay, Euripides states distinctly that, in his day, the
universally accepted physiological doctrine recognized only the share
taken by the father in procreation, and Hippocrates, in combating this
opinion, and contending that the child descended from both parents,
seems to admit that it was a prevalent heresy.[581] Finally, it seems
probable that the custom known under the name of “La Couvade”—that is,
the odd rule, prevalent among several peoples in different parts of
the world, requiring that the father, at the birth of his child, shall
retire to bed for some time, and fast or abstain from certain kinds of
food—implies some idea of relationship between the two.[582]

Admitting, however, that there was a time when fatherhood, in the
physiological sense of the term, was not discovered, I do not think
that the preference given to the female line is due to this fact. If
the denomination of children and the rules of succession really were
in the first place dependent on ideas of consanguinity, it might be
expected that a change with reference to the latter would be followed
by a change in the former respect also. But the ties of blood have
exercised a far less direct influence on the matter in question than
is generally supposed, the system of “kinship through females only”
being, properly speaking, quite different from what the words imply.

There may be several reasons for naming children after the mother
rather than after the father, apart from any consideration of
relationship. Especially among savages, the tie between a mother
and child is much stronger than that which binds a child to the
father.[583] Not only has she given birth to it, but she has also for
years been seen carrying it about at her breast. Moreover, in cases
of separation, occurring frequently at lower stages of civilization,
the infant children always follow the mother, and so, very often, do
the children more advanced in years. Is it not natural, then, that
they should keep the name of the mother rather than that of a father
whom they scarcely know? Mr. Belt tells us that the men and women even
of the christianised lower classes of Nicaragua often change their
mates, and the children, in such cases remaining with the mother, take
their surname from her.[584] According to Swann, the Creeks conferred
the honour of a chief on the issue of the female line, because it
was impossible to trace the right by the male issue, women only
exceptionally having more than two children by the same father.[585]
And touching the Khasias, one of the few tribes in India among whom
the female line prevails, Dr. Hooker states that they have a very
lax idea of marriage, divorce and exchange of wives being common and
attended with no disgrace; “the son therefore often forgets his
father’s name and person before he grows up, but becomes strongly
attached to his mother.”[586]

Speaking of certain negro tribes, Winterbottom suggested long ago that
the prevalence of the female line was to be explained by the practice
of polygyny,[587] and Dr. Starcke has recently called attention to
the same point.[588] The Rev. D. Macdonald likewise remarks, in
his account of the Efatese of the New Hebrides, that the idea that
children are more closely related to the mother than to the father
is an idea perfectly natural among a polygynous people.[589] It is
a customary arrangement in polygynous families that each wife has a
hut for herself, where she lives with her children; but even where
this is not the case, mother and children naturally keep together as
a little sub-family. No wonder, then, if a child takes its name after
the mother rather than after the father. This is the simplest way of
pointing out the distinction between the issue of different wives, a
distinction which is of special importance where it is accompanied
by different privileges as to succession. It is worth noticing that,
among the Negroes, who are probably the most polygynous race in the
world, the female line is extremely prevalent; whereas, among the Hill
Tribes of India, who are on the whole, monogamists, children, with
few exceptions, take the name of the father. With reference to the
Basutos, a Bechuana tribe, Mr. Casalis observes that the authority
of the eldest maternal uncle preponderates to excess, especially in
polygynous families, where the children have no strong affection for
their father.[590]

Further, among several peoples a man, on marrying, has to quit his
home, and go to live with his wife in the house of her father, of whose
family he becomes a member. This is a common practice among several of
the North American tribes,[591] and prevailed, in the southern part of
the New World, among the Caribs.[592] In some parts of Eastern Central
Africa, also, a man who marries a full grown girl “immediately leaves
his own village and proceeds to build a house in the village of his
wife.”[593] Among the Sengirese, according to Dr. Hickson, the man
always goes to his wife’s house, unless he be the son of a rajah, in
which case he may do as he pleases.[594] Dr. Hooker tells us that,
among the Khasias, “the husband does not take his wife home, but
enters her father’s household, and is entertained there.”[595] And in
Sumatra, in the mode of marriage called “ambel anak,” the father of
a virgin makes choice of some young man for her husband, who is taken
into his house to live there in a state between that of a son and that
of a debtor.[596]

According to Dr. Starcke, this custom is due to the great cohesive
power of the several families, which causes them to refuse to part
with any of their members. “Since men are more independent,” he says,
“they are also less stationary; they can no longer attract the women
to themselves, and are therefore attracted by them.[597] Under such
circumstances, there is nothing astonishing in the fact that children
are named after the mother’s tribe or clan, which is the case in
all the instances just given of peoples among whom the husband has
to settle down with his father-in-law. Indeed, Dr. Tylor has found
that, whilst the number of coincidences between peoples among whom
the husband lives with the wife’s family and peoples among whom the
maternal system prevails, is proportionally large, the full maternal
system never appears among peoples whose exclusive custom is for the
husband to take his wife to his own home.[598] And it is a remarkable
fact that where both customs—the woman receiving her husband in her own
hut, and the man taking his wife to his—occur side by side among the
same people, descent in the former cases is traced through the mother,
in the latter through the father.[599] In Japan, should there be only
daughters in the family, a husband is procured for the eldest, who
enters his wife’s family, and, at the same time, takes its name.[600]

Again, as to the rules of succession, Dr. Starcke has set forth the
hypothesis that they are dependent on local connections, those persons
being each other’s heirs who dwell together in one place. Among the
Iroquois, for instance, at the death of a man, his property is divided
among his brothers, sisters, and mother’s brothers, whilst the property
of a woman is transmitted to her children and sisters, but not to
her brothers. “Owing to the faculty of memory,” Dr. Starcke says,
“childhood and youth involve a young man in such a web of associations
that he afterwards finds it hard to detach himself from them. The man
who, when married, has lived as a stranger in the house of another,
clings to the impressions of his former home, and his earlier household
companions become his heirs. But the brother who has wandered elsewhere
stands in a more remote relation to his sister than do the sisters and
the children living with her in the parental home, and he is therefore
excluded from the inheritance.”[601]

Though agreeing, in the main, with Dr. Starcke’s hypothesis, I do not
think it affords a complete explanation of the matter. It certainly
accounts for the fact that, under the maternal system, it is just the
nearest relatives on the mother’s side who are a man’s heirs, to the
exclusion of other members of the clan. But, if succession really
depended upon local relations only, or upon the remembrance of such
relations in the past, it would be the most natural arrangement,
where father and children lived together till the latter were grown
up, for the father to be succeeded by his son. It seems probable that
the causes which make children take their mother’s name, have also
directly exercised some influence upon the rules of succession; but I
am inclined to believe that the power of the name itself has been of
the highest importance in that respect.

By means of family names former connections are kept up, and the past
is associated with the present. Even we ourselves are generally more
disposed to count kin with distant relatives having our own surname
than with those having another. And upon man in a savage state language
exercises, in this matter, a much greater influence than upon us. With
reference to the aborigines of Western Australia, Sir George Grey
observes, “Obligations of family names are much stronger than those
of blood;” and a “Saurian,” or a “Serpent,” from the East considers
himself related to a “Saurian,” or a “Serpent,” from the West, though
no such relationship may exist.[602] Among the Ossetes, according
to Baron von Haxthausen, a man is considered more nearly related to
a cousin a hundred times removed, who bears his name, than to his
mother’s brother; and he is bound to take blood revenge for the former,
while the latter is in fact not regarded as a relative at all.[603]
Speaking of certain Bantu tribes, Mr. McCall Theal remarks that their
aversion to incestuous marriages is so strong, that a man will not
marry a girl who belongs to another tribe, if she has the same family
name as himself, although the relationship cannot be traced.[604] Is
it not a justifiable presumption that a similar association of ideas
has influenced the rules of succession also,—all the more so, where
community of name implies community of worship as well? It should be
observed that in every case—at least so far as I know—where rank and
property are inherited through females only, children are named after
the mother,—but not _vice versa_, thanks to the direct influence of
local and other connections. In China, a man is even strictly forbidden
to nominate as his heir an individual of a different surname.[605]

It is a difficult, sometimes even a hopeless, task to try to find out
the origin of savage laws and customs, and I do not pretend to have
given an exhaustive explanation of those in question. But it seems to
be sufficiently clear, from what has been said, that we have no right
to ascribe them to uncertain paternity; nay, that such an assumption
is not even probably true. No one has yet exhibited any general
coincidence of what we consider moral and immoral habits with the
prevalence of the male and female line among existing savages. Among
the Barea, for instance, as among the Negroes of Loango, inheritance
goes through mothers only, though adultery is said to be extremely
rare;[606] whilst, on the other hand, among the wanton natives of
Tahiti, possessions always descend to the eldest son. With the Todas
and Tibetans, among whom paternity is often actually uncertain on
account of their polyandrous marriage customs, succession runs through
the male line only. “If one or more women,” Mr. Marshall says with
reference to the former, “are in common to several men, each husband
considers all the children as his—though each woman is mother only
to her own—and each male child is an heir to the property of all of
the fathers.”[607] Among the Reddies, a son—although it often happens
that he does not know his real father—is the heir of his mother’s
husband.[608] And, in India and Ceylon, female kinship is associated
with polyandry of the _beena_ type—where the husbands come to live
with the wife in or near the house of her birth; and male kinship with
that of the _deega_ type—where the wife goes to live in the house and
village of her husband.[609]

Lastly, as Mr. Spencer remarks, avowed recognition of kinship in the
female line only, shows by no means an unconsciousness of male kinship.
As a proof of this may be adduced the converse custom which the early
Romans had of recognizing no legal relationship between children of the
same mother and of different fathers. For, if it cannot be supposed
that an actual unconsciousness of motherhood was associated with this
system, neither is there any adequate warrant for the supposition that
actual unconsciousness of fatherhood was associated with the system of
“kinship through females only” among savages.[610]

The prevalence of the female line would not presuppose general
promiscuity even if, in some cases, it were dependent on uncertainty as
to fathers.[611] The separation of husband and wife, adultery on the
woman’s side, and the practice of lending wives to visitors occurring
very frequently among many savage nations, the proverb which says, “It
is a wise child that knows his own father,” holds true for a large
number of them. According to Mr. Ingham, the Bakongo, who trace their
descent through the mother only, assert as a reason for this custom
uncertain paternity; but nevertheless, as we have already seen, they
would be horrified at the idea of promiscuous intercourse.

       *       *       *       *       *

Having now examined all the groups of social phenomena adduced as
evidence for the hypothesis of promiscuity, we have found that, in
point of fact, they are no evidence. Not one of the customs alleged as
relics of an ancient state of indiscriminate cohabitation of the sexes,
or “communal marriage,” presupposes the former existence of that
state. The numerous facts put forward in support of the hypothesis do
not entitle us to assume that promiscuity has ever been the prevailing
form of sexual relations among a single people, far less that it has
constituted a general stage in the social development of man, and,
least of all, that such a stage formed the starting-point of all human
history.

It may seem to the reader that this question has received more
attention than it deserves. But I have discussed it so fully not only
because of the importance of the subject, but because of the insight
the customs mentioned give us into sexual and family relations very
different from our own, and because the unscientific character of the
conclusions we have tested shows most clearly that sociology is still a
science in its infancy.

Even now my criticism is not finished. Having shown that the hypothesis
of promiscuity has no foundation in fact, I shall endeavour, in the
next chapter, to demonstrate that it is opposed to all the correct
ideas we are able to form with regard to the early condition of man.




CHAPTER VI

A CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY

(_Concluded_)


Against the hypothesis of promiscuity Sir Henry Maine has urged that
a good deal of evidence seems to show that promiscuous intercourse
between the sexes tends to a pathological condition very unfavourable
to fecundity; and “infecundity, amid perpetually belligerent savages,
implies weakness and ultimate destruction.”[612]

Dr. Carpenter refers to the efforts of the American planters to form
the negroes into families, as the promiscuity into which they were
liable to fall produced infertility, and fertility had become important
to the slave-owners through the prohibition of the slave-trade.[613] It
is also a well-known fact that prostitutes very seldom have children,
while, according to Dr. Roubaud, those of them who marry young easily
become mothers.[614] “Il ne pousse pas d’herbe dans les chemins où
tout le monde passe,” Dr. Bertillon remarks.[615] And, in a community
where all the women equally belonged to all the men, the younger and
prettier ones would of course be most sought after, and take up a
position somewhat akin to that of the prostitutes of modern society.

It may perhaps be urged that the practice of polyandry prevails among
several peoples without any evil results as regards fecundity being
heard of. But polyandry scarcely ever implies continued promiscuous
intercourse of many men with one woman. In Tibet, for example, where
the brothers of a family very often have a common wife, more than one
are seldom at home at the same time.[616] Mr. Talboys Wheeler has
even suggested that polyandry arose among a pastoral people, whose
men were away from their families for months at a time, so that the
duty of protecting these families would naturally be undertaken by
the brothers in turn.[617] Again, among the Kaniagmuts, the second
husband was only a deputy who acted as husband and master of the house
during the absence of the true lord;[618] and the same was the case
in Nukahiva.[619] But especially remarkable is the following practice
connected with polyandry. In the description given by Bontier and Le
Verrier of the conquest and conversion of the Canarians in 1402 by
Jean de Bethencourt we read that, in the island of Lancerote, most of
the women have three husbands, “who wait upon them alternately by
months; the husband that is to live with the wife the following month
waits upon her and upon her other husband the whole of the month that
the latter has her, and so each takes her in turn.”[620] Mr. Harkness
tells us about a Toda who, having referred to his betrothal to his wife
Pilluvāni and the subsequent betrothal of the latter to two others,
Khakhood and Tūmbut, said, “Now, according to our customs, Pilluvāni
was to pass the first month with me, the second with Khakhood, and the
third with Tūmbut.”[621] Among the Kulus, in the Himalaya Mountains,
when parents sell a daughter to several brothers, she belongs during
the first month to the eldest brother, during the second to the next
eldest, and so on;[622] whilst, as regards the Nairs, whose women,
except those of the first quality, may marry twelve husbands if they
pleased. Hamilton states that “all the husbands agree very well, for
they cohabit with her in their turns, according to their priority of
marriage, ten days, more or less, according as they can fix a term
among themselves.”[623]

       *       *       *       *       *

The strongest argument against ancient promiscuity is, however, to be
derived from the psychical nature of man and other mammals. Mr. Darwin
remarks that from what we know of the jealousy of all male quadrupeds,
armed, as many of them are, with special weapons for battling with
their rivals, promiscuous intercourse is utterly unlikely to prevail
in a state of nature. “Therefore,” he continues, “looking far enough
back in the stream of time, and judging from the social habits of man
as he now exists, the most probable view is that he aboriginally lived
in small communities, each with a single wife, or if powerful with
several, whom he jealously guarded against all other men.”[624] Yet,
according to the same naturalist, it seems certain, from the lines of
evidence afforded by Mr. Morgan, Mr. McLennan, and Sir J. Lubbock, that
almost promiscuous intercourse at a later time was extremely common
throughout the world;[625] and a similar view is held by some other
writers.[626] But if jealousy can be proved to be universally prevalent
in the human race at the present day, it is impossible to believe that
there ever was a time when man was devoid of that powerful feeling.
Professor Giraud-Teulon[627] and Dr. Le Bon[628] assert, indeed, that
it is unknown among almost all civilized peoples; but this assertion
will be found to be groundless.

Starting from the very lowest races of men: we are told that the
Fuegians “are exceedingly jealous of their women, and will not
allow any one, if they can help it, to enter their huts, particularly
boys.”[629] Several writers assert the same as regards the
Australians.[630] Thus, according to Sir George Grey, “a stern and
vigilant jealousy is commonly felt by every married man;”[631] and Mr.
Curr states that, in most tribes, a woman “is not allowed to converse
or have any relations whatever with any adult male, save her husband.
Even with a grown-up brother she is always forbidden to exchange a
word.”[632] With reference to the Veddahs of Ceylon, Mr. Bailey says
that, with the very smallest cause, the men are exceedingly jealous of
their most unattractive wives, and are very careful to keep them apart
from their companions.[633]

According to a Thlinket myth, the jealousy of man is older than the
world itself. There was an age, it is supposed, when men groped in the
dark in search of the world. At that time a Thlinket lived who had a
wife and sister; and he was so jealous of his wife, that he killed all
his sister’s children because they looked at her.[634]

Great jealousy is met with among the Atkha Aleuts, according to
Father Yakof; among the Kutchin Indians, according to Richardson and
Hardisty; among the Haidahs, according to Dixon; among the Tacullis,
according to Harmon; among the Crees, according to Richardson.[635]
The Indians on the Eastern side of the Rocky Mountains visited by
Harmon, in their fits of jealousy, “often cut off all the hair from
the heads of their wives, and, not unfrequently, cut off their noses
also; and should they not in the moment of passion have a knife at
hand, they will snap it off at one bite, with their teeth.... The man
is satisfied in thus revenging a supposed injury; and having destroyed
the beauty of his wife, he concludes that he has secured her against
all future solicitations to offend.”[636] In California, if a married
native woman is seen even walking in the forest with another man
than her husband, she is chastised by him, whilst a repetition of
the offence is generally punished with speedy death.[637] Among the
Creeks, “it was formerly reckoned adultery, if a man took a pitcher
of water off a married woman’s head, and drank of it.”[638] The Moquis
allow their wives to work only indoors, afraid of having rivals.[639]
The Arawaks,[640] as also the Indians of Peru,[641] are stated to
commit horrible crimes of jealousy. The Botocudos, who are known to
change wives very frequently, are, nevertheless, much addicted to that
passion.[642] And, regarding the Coroados of Brazil, v. Spix and v.
Martius say that revenge and jealousy are the only passions that can
rouse their stunted soul from its moody indifference.[643]

In the Sandwich Islands, according to Lisiansky, jealousy was extremely
prevalent,[644] and, in Nukahiva, the men punish their wives with
severity upon the least suspicion of infidelity.[645] The Areois of
Tahiti, too, although given to every kind of licentiousness, are
described by Ellis as utterly jealous.[646] The same is said of the
New Caledonians and New Zealanders;[647] whilst, in the Pelew Islands,
it is forbidden even to speak about another man’s wife or mention her
name.[648] In short, the South Sea Islanders are, as Mr. Macdonald
remarks, generally jealous of the chastity of their wives.[649]

Among the Malays of Sumatra, the husband jealously guards his wife
as long as his affection lasts;[650] and, concerning several other
tribes of the Indian Archipelago, Riedel says that the men are very
much addicted to the same passion.[651] Captain Arnesen observed the
great jealousy of the Samoyedes.[652] Dr. A. O. Heikel informs me that
a Tartar may repudiate his wife if he sees her shaking hands with a
man. Among the nomadic Koriaks, many wives are killed by passionate
husbands. Hence their women endeavour to be very ugly: they refrain
from dressing their hair or washing, and walk about ragged, as the
husbands take for granted that, if they dress themselves, they do so in
order to attract admirers.[653]

Among the Beni-Mzab, a man who speaks in the street to a married
woman of quality is punished with a fine of two hundred francs and
banishment for four years.[654] In the Nile countries and many other
parts of Africa, it is customary for the men to preserve the fidelity
of their wives in a way not unlike a method used in the age of the
Crusades.[655] With reference to the inhabitants of Fida, Bosman tells
us that a rich negro will not suffer any man to enter the houses where
his wives reside, and on the least suspicion will sell them to the
Europeans;[656] whilst in Dahomey, if a wayfarer meets any of the royal
wives on the road, a bell warns him “to turn off or stand against a
wall while they pass.”[657]

That jealousy is a powerful agent in the social life of civilized
nations is a fact which it is unnecessary to dwell upon. In Mohammedan
countries, a woman is not allowed to receive male visitors, or to go
out unveiled,[658] it being unlawful for the Moslem to see the faces
of any other women than those whom he is forbidden to marry and his
own wives and female slaves.[659] A man who penetrates into the harem
of another man may easily lose his life; and Dr. Polak states that, in
Persia, a European physician cannot, without being considered indecent,
even ask about the health of a Mohammedan’s wife and daughter, though
they are ill.[660] Again, in Japan, as I am told by a native of the
country, it was customary for women when getting married, to have
their eyebrows shaved off, because thick and beautiful eyebrows are
considered one of a woman’s greatest ornaments. At the same time,
according to Mr. Balfour, their teeth are stained black, which can only
have the effect of making the wife less attractive to the husband,—as
well as to other men.[661] This reminds us of the wide-spread practice
of depriving a woman of her ornaments as soon as she is married.

The prevalence of jealousy in the human race is best shown by the
punishments inflicted for adultery; although it may be that the
proprietary feeling here plays an important part. In a savage country a
seducer may be thankful if he escapes by paying to the injured husband
the value of the bride or some other fine, or if the penalty is reduced
to a flogging, to his head being shaved, his ears cut off, one of his
eyes destroyed, his legs speared, &c., &c. He must consider himself
very lucky if he is merely paid in his own coin, or if the punishment
falls on his wife, who, in that case, seems to be looked upon as the
real cause of her husband’s unfaithfulness.[662] Most commonly, among
uncivilized nations, the seducer is killed, adultery on the woman’s
side being considered a heinous crime, for which nothing but the
death of the offender can atone. Among the Waganda, it is, as a rule,
punished even more severely than murder;[663] and, in parts of New
Guinea, capital punishment is said to be almost unknown except for
adultery.[664]

Mr. Reade remarks that, among savages generally, it is the seducer who
suffers, not the victim.[665] Yet this holds good for certain peoples
only,[666] the faithless wife being generally discarded, beaten, or
ill-treated in some other way, and very frequently killed. Often, too,
she is disfigured by her jealous husband, so that no man may fall in
love with her in future. Thus, among several peoples of North America,
India, and elsewhere, her nose is cut or bitten off,—a practice which
also prevailed in ancient Egypt.[667] As late as the year 1120 the
Council of Neapolis in Palestine decreed that an adulterer should be
castrated, and the nose of an unfaithful wife cut off;[668] whilst, in
the “Uplands-lag,” an old Swedish provincial law, it is prescribed
that an adulteress who cannot pay the fine of forty marks, shall lose
her hair, ears, and nose.[669] The Creeks and some Chittagong Hill
tribes likewise cut off the ears of a woman who has been guilty of
infidelity;[670] and many other people are in the habit of shaving her
head.[671]

Among a large number of peoples, a husband not only requires chastity
from his wife, but demands that the woman whom he marries shall be a
virgin. There can be little doubt, I think, that this requirement owes
its origin to the same powerful feeling that keeps watch over marital
faithfulness.

Among the Ahts, for example, “a girl who was known to have lost her
