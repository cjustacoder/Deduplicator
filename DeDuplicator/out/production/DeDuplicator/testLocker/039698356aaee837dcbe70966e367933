ifficult to adduce direct evidence for the evil effects of
consanguineous marriages. We cannot expect very conspicuous results
from other alliances than those between the nearest relations—between
brothers and sisters, parents and children. And the injurious results
even of such unions would not necessarily appear at once. Sir J.
Sebright remarks that there may be families of domestic animals which
go through several generations without sustaining much injury from
having been bred in-and-in,[1996] and the offspring of self-fertilized
plants do not always show any loss of vigour in the first generations.
Man cannot, in this respect, be subjected to experiments like those
tried in the case of other animals, and habitual intermarriage of the
very nearest relations is, as we have seen, exceedingly rare. Mr. Adam
argues that there is no proof of the physical deterioration of those
divisions of mankind amongst whom incestuous unions are known more or
less to have prevailed—as the Egyptians and Persians.[1997] But among
these nations marriage certainly did not always take place between
closely related persons; and breeders of domestic animals inform us
that the mixing-in even of a drop of unrelated blood is sufficient
almost to neutralize the injurious effects of long continued close
interbreeding. Again, Mr. Huth asserts that, though the Ptolemies
habitually married their sisters, nieces, and cousins, they were
neither sterile nor particularly short-lived.[1998] Mr. Galton, on the
contrary, sees in Ptolemaic experience a proof that close intermarriage
is followed by sterility.[1999] In ten marriages between brothers and
sisters, uncles and nieces, or between first-cousins, the average
number of children was not quite two, and three of the unions were
entirely sterile.[2000]

The Veddahs of Ceylon are probably the most in-and-in bred people that
ever existed. Among them, the practice of a man marrying his younger
sister did not occur only occasionally; according to Mr. Bailey, it
was _the_ proper marriage. Among the Bintenne Veddahs, it may be said
to have been, for perhaps two generations or so, extinct, whilst among
those of Nilgala, it is at most only disappearing. Mr. Bailey believes
that this practice is quite sufficient to account for the short stature
as well as the weak and vacant expression of this people. He did not
find many traces of insanity, idiocy, and epilepsy—maladies which
such marriages, according to a common belief, might be supposed to
produce. “But in other respects,” he says, “the injurious effects of
this custom would seem to be plainly discernible. The race is rapidly
becoming extinct; large families are all but unknown, and longevity
is very rare. I have been at some pains to obtain reliable data to
elucidate these points. Out of seventy-two Veddahs in Nilgala, fifty
were adults, and twenty-two children. In one small sept, or family,
there were nine adults and one child; in another, one child and eight
adults; and so on. In Bintenne, out of three hundred and eight Veddahs,
a hundred and seventy-five were adults and a hundred and thirty-three
children. Here the disproportion is not so marked; but in one of the
smaller tribes, more isolated than the rest, there were twenty adults,
and but four children. The paucity of children, I think, must be
ascribed to the degeneracy produced by such close intermarriages, for
I have never heard a suspicion of infanticide existing among them.
Out of fifty adults in Nilgala, only one appeared to have numbered
seventy years, and but eight to have exceeded fifty. In Bintenne, of a
hundred and seventy-five adults, two only seemed to have reached their
seventieth, and but fourteen to have exceeded their fiftieth year. Such
statistics seem to show the practical results of such connections.
The Nilgala Veddahs, who still maintain an almost total isolation
from other people, are rapidly disappearing. The Veddahs of Bintenne,
who have abandoned the pernicious custom which I have described, and
still intermarry among themselves, are becoming extinct, though more
gradually.”[2001]

With the exception of this case, the closest kind of intermarriage
which we have opportunities of studying is that between first cousins.
Unfortunately, the observations hitherto made on the subject are
far from decisive. Several writers, as M. Périer, Dr. Voisin, and
Mr. Huth, believe that there are no injurious results at all from
those marriages, unless the parents are afflicted with the same
hereditary morbid tendencies,[2002] whilst others, as M. Devay and
M. Boudin, express the most alarming opinions as to the bad effects
of consanguineous marriages. Such alliances are supposed to bring
evils of many different kinds upon a population, as sterility,
idiocy, epilepsy, insanity, deaf-muteism, congenital malformations
in the offspring, cretinism, albinoism,[2003] &c. But how little the
statements of the various writers agree with each other appears,
for instance, from the fact that M. Boudin found the proportion
of deaf-mutes born in consanguineous marriages, in the Imperial
Institution of Deaf-Mutes at Paris, to be 28·35 per cent., whereas,
according to Dr. Mitchell, it amounts to 5·17 per cent. in Scotch and
English institutions.[2004]

As it is impossible to dwell here upon the investigations of the
several writers, of which Mr. Huth has given so complete an account,
I shall confine myself to a statement of the general results attained
by those investigators who have founded their inquiries on a more
trustworthy statistical basis.

Adopting a method different from that of his predecessors, Professor
G. H. Darwin has endeavoured first to discover the proportion of
consanguineous marriages in the whole population, and then to find out
whether the offspring of those marriages exhibit a greater percentage
of individuals, defective in one way or another, than the offspring
of non-consanguineous marriages. His investigations tend decidedly to
invalidate the exaggerated conclusions of many previous writers, but
he thinks that “there are nevertheless grounds for asserting that
various maladies take an easy hold of the offspring of consanguineous
marriages.”[2005] He did not find evidence that the marriage of
first cousins had any effect in the production of infertility,
deaf-muteism, insanity, or idiocy, but he observed a slightly lowered
vitality amongst the offspring of first cousins, and a somewhat
higher death-rate than amongst the families of non-consanguineous
marriages.[2006] Moreover, the numbers of boating men belonging to the
twenty boats at Oxford and thirty at Cambridge, in the first and second
division, and those of selected athletes from some schools in England,
justified, to some extent, the belief “that offspring of first cousins
are deficient physically, whilst at the same time they negative the
views of alarmist writers on the subject.”[2007] It is curious that, in
spite of such unambiguous statements, Mr. Darwin’s paper has generally
been quoted as an evidence of the perfect harmlessness of first cousin
marriages.

M. Stieda has found that, in the departments of France, the number
of bodily or mentally infirm people increases almost constantly in
proportion to the number of consanguineous marriages, as will be seen
from the following table:—

The Danish physician, Dr. Mygge, published in 1879 a book on ‘Marriage
between Blood-Relations,’ which unfortunately has received much less
attention than it deserves.[2009] Thanks to the trustworthiness of the
method, the number of cases considered, and the author’s impartiality,
it is probably the most important statistical contribution hitherto
issued on this subject. Dr. Mygge found, from the information he
received from various parts of Denmark, that in that country, or at
least in the parishes of it which came under his observation, there
occur, among the children of related persons, comparatively more
idiots, lunatics, epileptics, and deaf-mutes than among others. He
considers it probable, too, though not proved, that such children die
in a higher ratio and are more liable to certain diseases. But, on the
other hand, he did not notice any perceptible difference in fertility
between consanguineous and crossed marriages.[2010]

In these inquiries, Dr. Mygge followed the method applied by the
Norwegian physician Ludvig Dahl twenty years earlier. Through careful
investigation of 246 marriages, eighty-five of which were between
first cousins and four between still nearer relations, this inquirer
was led to the conclusions that consanguineous marriages are somewhat
less fertile than crossed marriages; that they produce comparatively
many more still-born and sickly children; and that insanity, idiocy,
deaf-dumbness, and epilepsy occur about eleven times as often among the
offspring of relations, as among the offspring of unrelated parents.
But he admitted that the numbers compared were too small to make his
conclusions decisive.[2011]

These results are of course to a great extent conjectural. But it is
noteworthy that, of all the writers who have discussed the subject,
the majority, and certainly not the least able of them, have expressed
their belief in marriages between first cousins being more or less
unfavourable to the offspring.[2012] And no evidence which can stand
the test of scientific investigation has hitherto been adduced against
this view.

Some writers have, indeed, cited instances of communities where
consanguineous marriages have occurred constantly without any evil
effects having appeared. Thus the Pitcairn Island, uninhabited till the
year 1790, was at that time peopled by nine white men, and six men and
twelve women of Tahiti. In 1800 the population consisted of one man,
five women, and nineteen children; and the descendants of these persons
are stated by later travellers to be strong and healthy without any
traces of degeneration. Omitting whatever else may be said against
this case as evidence for the harmlessness of consanguineous marriages,
I need only call attention to the facts that, since the colonization
of this island, a few strangers have joined the little colony; that it
was once removed to Norfolk Island, and that, of those who returned,
one was a Norfolk Islander who had married a Pitcairn girl; that the
island has frequently been visited by ships with their crews;[2013] and
that, as Beechey expressly states, the same restrictions with regard to
intermarriage of relations exist here as in England.[2014]

There are several isolated communities—in Java, Peru, Great Britain,
France, Scandinavia, &c.—which intermarry solely among themselves
without any evil effects being discernible. An often-quoted case is
the community of Batz (3,300 persons), situated near Croisic on a
peninsula. The inhabitants of this community have been in the habit
of closely intermarrying among themselves from time immemorial.
Nevertheless, they are almost all very well in health without any
hereditary affection. But Dr. Voisin observes, “Les conditions
climatériques de la commune de Batz, son voisinage de la mer, l’hygiène
et les habitudes de ses habitants, semblent s’accorder pour empêcher
la dégénérescence de l’espèce et paraissent expliquer l’innocuité
des mariages entre consanguins qui s’y pratiquent depuis plusieurs
siècles.”[2015] In other isolated communities the population is not so
numerous, and the sanitary conditions are not perhaps so favourable:
but in any case we may say that this local endogamy is generally
something quite different from marriage with near relations. Dr.
Mitchell found that, in almost all the isolated communities along
the coasts of Scotland, which had been given as instances of close
interbreeding, such marriages were comparatively rare. According to
Dr. Mygge, the like is true of the population of Lyø and Strynø in
Denmark.[2016] And Dr. Andrew Wood states, of the fisher-folk of
Newhaven, that, though they keep themselves much segregated, they are
very careful regarding intermarriage, and look upon the union of
relatives as an infringement of the laws of morality.[2017]

Moreover, even if it could be proved that, in particular cases, close
intermarrying, though continued for a long time, has been followed by
no bad consequences, this would be no evidence that consanguineous
marriages are as a rule innocuous. In some parishes of Denmark Dr.
Mygge found no evil effects of such marriages, whilst in others they
were very conspicuous.[2018] And from the investigations of Mr. Darwin
it appears that, notwithstanding the injury which most plants suffer
from self-fertilization, a few have almost certainly been propagated
in a state of nature for thousands of generations without having been
once intercrossed. It is impossible to understand, he says, why some
individuals even of the _same species_ are sterile, whilst others are
quite fertile, with their own pollen.[2019]

There is evidence that the bad consequences of self-fertilization
and close interbreeding may almost fail to appear under favourable
conditions of life. In-and-in bred plants, when allowed enough space
and good soil, frequently show little or no deterioration: whereas,
when placed in competition with another plant, they often perish or
are much stunted.[2020] Crampe’s experiments with brown rats proved
that the breeding in-and-in was much less injurious, if the offspring
of the related parents were well fed and taken care of, than if it was
otherwise.[2021] And this is in striking accordance with Dr. Mitchell’s
observations as to consanguineous marriages in Scotland. The results
there appear to be least grave, and are frequently almost _nil_, if
the parents and children live in tolerable comfort, without anxiety or
much thought for the morrow, and easily earning enough to procure good
food and clothing—in short, when they work, but do not struggle for
existence. On the other hand, when they are “poor, pinched for food,
scrimp of clothing, badly housed, and exposed to misery; when they have
to toil and struggle for the bare necessaries of life—never having
enough for to-day and being always fearful of to-morrow,”—the evil may
become very marked.[2022]

If this is the case, we must expect to find that consanguineous
marriages are much more injurious in savage regions, where the struggle
for existence is often very severe, than they have proved to be in
civilized society, especially as it is among the well-off classes that
such marriages occur most frequently.[2023] In England, according to
Mr. G. H. Darwin, cousin-marriages among the aristocracy are probably
4½ per cent.; among the middle and upper middle class, or among the
landed gentry, 3½ per cent.; but in London, comprising all classes,
they are probably only 1½ per cent.[2024] He thinks that the slightness
of the evils which he found to result from first-cousin marriages
perhaps depends upon the fact that a large majority of Englishmen live
under what are on the whole very favourable circumstances.[2025] We
must also, however, remember that there has been a great mixture of
races in Europe, and that this necessarily makes marriage of kinsfolk
less injurious, so far as the evil results of such unions depend upon
too great a likeness between the sexual elements.

The conclusion that closely related marriages produce more destructive
effects among savage than civilized peoples, derives perhaps, some
additional probability from certain ethnological facts. These facts
may, at least, serve to show that such marriages, and the experience
of isolated communities, are not everywhere in favour of Mr. Huth’s
conclusions. Several statements on the subject have, indeed, scarcely
any value as direct evidence for the harmfulness of consanguineous
marriages, but to two or three considerable weight must be attached.

According to v. Martius, who is a great authority on Brazilian
ethnography, it is a well-established fact, observed everywhere, that
the smaller and more isolated of the Indian communities, scarcely any
members of which marry members of other communities, are much more
liable to every kind of deterioration than the larger groups.[2026]
“It is probable,” Mr. Bates, another most capable judge, remarks with
reference to the savage tribes on the Upper Amazons, “that the strange
inflexibility of the Indian organization, both bodily and mental, is
owing to the isolation in which each small tribe has lived, and to
the narrow round of life and thought, and close intermarriages for
countless generations, which are the necessary results. Their fecundity
is of a low degree, for it is very rare to find an Indian family having
so many as four children, and we have seen how great is their liability
to sickness and death on removal from place to place.”[2027] Touching
the Isánna Indians, Mr. Wallace asserts that they are said not to be
nearly so numerous, nor to increase so rapidly, as the Uaupés; which
may perhaps be owing to their marrying with relations, while the latter
prefer strangers.[2028] And v. Tschudi supposes that the low fecundity
of the Botocudos is caused by their endogamous habits; for when their
women marry out of their own horde, especially with whites or negroes,
they are generally very fertile.[2029]

The Calidonian Indians of the Isthmus of Darien, according to Mr.
Gisborne, are bound never to cross the breed with foreigners;
hence intermarriage is very constant, and, as he remarks, the race
degenerates.[2030] The Pueblos in New Mexico, too, are said to
deteriorate because of their constant intermarriage in the same
village.[2031] As regards the Hottentots, Barrow remarks, “The
impolitic custom of hording together in families, and of not marrying
out of their own kraals, has no doubt tended to enervate this race of
men, and reduced them to their present degenerated condition, which is
that of a languid, listless phlegmatic people, in whom the prolific
powers of nature seem to be almost exhausted.” Few of the women have
more than two or three children, and many of them are barren. But this
is not the case when a Hottentot woman is connected with a white man.
“The fruit of such an alliance,” says Barrow, “is not only in general
numerous, but they are beings of a very different nature from the
Hottentot.”[2032]

In too early marriages, the licentious habits of both sexes, and
the intermarriage of near relatives, the Rev. J. Sibree finds the
causes of the infertility of the women of Madagascar.[2033] Among
the Garos, the chiefs have, in comparison with the lower classes,
degenerated physically, and Colonel Dalton is inclined to think that
this degeneration is a result of close interbreeding.[2034] The
Lundu Sea Dyaks, according to Sir Spenser St. John, have decreased
greatly in numbers—from a thousand families to ten. “They complain
bitterly,” he says, “that they have no families, that their women are
not fertile; indeed, there were but three or four children in the
whole place. The men were fine-looking and the women well-favoured and
healthy—remarkably clean and free from disease. We could only account
for their decreasing numbers by their constant intermarriages.”[2035]
Mr. Foreman thinks that the low intellect and mental debility
perceptible in many families among the domesticated natives of the
Philippines are due to consanguineous marriages.[2036] Mr. Bachelor
connects the rapid decrease of the Ainos with their endogamous
habits.[2037] And Mr. Meade remarks, with regard to the Maoris, that
one of the principal causes of the diminishing population is said to be
their intermarriages, which cause barrenness among the women.[2038]

Of no little interest to us are the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills. Mr.
Marshall remarks that, among them, relationship is intimate far beyond
that witnessed in any country approaching civilization—“intimate to
such a degree, that the whole tribe, where not parents and children,
brothers and sisters, are all first cousins, descended from lines of
first cousins prolonged for centuries.”[2039] As regards the general
appearance of the people, a large proportion of both sexes and of all
ages are doubtless in excellent health, and their fecundity, according
to Dr. Shortt, is by no means of a low degree.[2040] Nevertheless, the
Todas are dying out. In infancy the mortality is so great that, as a
rule, there is in each family only a small number of children.[2041]
“It is rarely that there are more than two or three children,” says
the missionary Metz, “and it is not at all an uncommon thing to
find only a single child, while many families have none at all.” The
numbers of the Todas have, consequently, for years past been gradually
declining, and probably the time is not far distant when they will have
passed away.[2042] Of course, we do not know whether this depends upon
their close intermarriages, but there is, at any rate, some reason to
suspect that this is the case. That the intermarrying has not produced
more evil effects on the population, may possibly be owing to the
wealth for which the Neilgherry Hills are remarkable, and to their
climate, which, for mildly invigorating properties and equable seasonal
changes throughout the year, is perhaps unrivalled anywhere within the
tropics.[2043]

Another very much in-and-in bred people are the Persians. Among them,
husband and wife are generally of the same family, and very often
cousins. Yet Dr. Polak who has lived in Persia for nine years, partly
as a teacher in the medical school of Teheran, partly as physician to
the Shah, and during this residence has had excellent opportunities of
acquainting himself with the conditions of the people, has not observed
that the diseases which are supposed to result from consanguineous
marriages prevail more frequently there than elsewhere. Nor has he
found that the Persian women are generally less fertile than others.
Yet the families are exceedingly small, as the mortality among children
is enormous. Of six, perhaps two as a rule survive, but very often none
at all, most of them dying in their second year. Dr. Polak believes,
indeed, that, on an average, scarcely more than one living child comes
to each woman. A princess in Teheran was looked upon quite as a wonder
because she had eight children alive, and the European physician
was asked if he ever before, in his own country, had seen a similar
case.[2044]

More important than any of these statements is the following testimony
concerning the Karens of Burma, for which I am indebted to the Rev.
Dr. Alonzo Bunker, who has been a resident among that people during
more than twenty years. He says that, in some of their villages,
exogamy prevails, in others endogamy, but marriages between parents
and children, brothers and sisters, are prohibited everywhere, and
even first cousins very seldom marry, though there is no law against
such connections. There is a striking difference with regard to
stature, health, strength and fecundity, between the inhabitants of
the exogamous and those of the endogamous villages, the latter being
much inferior in all these respects. Dr. Bunker has no doubt that this
inferiority is owing to the intermarriage of kinsfolk, and he asserts
that even the natives themselves ascribe it to this cause, though they
obstinately keep up the old custom, regarding marriages out of their
own village as highly unbecoming. In cases in which missionaries have
been able to persuade young men to choose wives from another village,
Dr. Bunker assures me that the good effects of a cross appeared at
once.[2045]

There are some other peoples who ascribe evil results to close
intermarriage. Mr. Cousins informs me that the Cis-Natalian Kafirs
believe “that their offspring would be of a more sickly nature if
such were allowed”; and Mr. Eyles writes that the Zulus, on the border
of Pondoland, regard sterility and deformity as consequences of
consanguineous unions. The Australian Dieyerie, according to Mr. Gason,
have a tradition that, after the creation, fathers, mothers, sisters,
brothers, and others of the closest kin intermarried promiscuously,
until the bad effects of these marriages became manifest. A council of
the chiefs was then assembled to consider in what way the evil might be
averted, and the result of their deliberations was a petition to the
Muramura, or Good Spirit. In answer to this he ordered that the tribe
should be divided into branches, and distinguished one from the other
by different names, after objects animate and inanimate, such as dogs,
mice, emu, rain, and so forth, and that the members of any such branch
should be forbidden to marry other members of the same branch.[2046]
Again, touching the Kenai, in the north-western part of North America,
Richardson states, “It was the custom that the men of one stock should
choose their wives from another, and the offspring belonged to the race
of the mother. This custom has fallen into disuse, and marriages in the
same tribe occur; but the old people say that mortality among the Kenai
has arisen from the neglect of the ancient usage.”[2047]

In a Greenland Eskimo tale, the father of Kakamak, finding that all his
grandchildren have died before reaching the age of puberty, suggests to
his son-in-law, “Perhaps we are too near akin.”[2048] Two Mohammedan
travellers of the ninth century tell us that the Hindus never married
a relation, because they thought alliances between unrelated persons
improved the offspring.[2049] In Hadîth, the collection of Mohammedan
traditions, it is said, “Marry among strangers; thus you will not
have feeble posterity.” “This view,” says Goldziher, “coincides
with the opinion of the ancient Arabs that the children of endogamous
marriages are weakly and lean. To this class also belongs the proverb
of Al-Meydânî, ‘ ... Marry the distant, marry not the near’ (in
relationship).” A poet, praising a hero, says, “He is a hero, not
borne by the cousin (of his father), he is not weakly; for the seed of
relations brings forth feeble fruit.”[2050]

In opposition to the view that these opinions are the results of
experience, it may be urged that any infraction of the customs or
laws of ancestors is commonly thought to call down divine vengeance.
Father Veniaminof tells us that, among the early Aleuts, incest,
which was considered the gravest crime, was believed to be always
followed by the birth of monsters with walrus-tusks, beard, and other
disfiguration;[2051] and among the Kafirs, according to Mr. Fynn, it
is a general belief that the offspring of an incestuous union will be
a monster—“a punishment inflicted by the ancestral spirit.”[2052]
But whatever may be said of the other cases referred to, no such
explanation can possibly hold good for the Arabs. Among them, marriage
with a near relation involved no infringement of their marriage
regulations. On the contrary, in spite of the opinions in favour of
exogamy, the preference for marriage with a cousin was dominant among
them, and a man had even a right to the hand of his “bint ‘amm,” the
daughter of a paternal uncle.[2053]

Taking all these facts into consideration, I cannot but believe that
consanguineous marriages, in some way or other, are more or less
detrimental to the species. And here, I think, we may find a quite
sufficient explanation of the horror of incest; not because man at an
early stage recognized the injurious influence of close intermarriage,
but because the law of natural selection must inevitably have operated.
Among the ancestors of man, as among other animals, there was no doubt
a time when blood-relationship was no bar to sexual intercourse. But
variations, here as elsewhere, would naturally present themselves;
and those of our ancestors who avoided in-and-in breeding would
survive, while the others would gradually decay and ultimately perish.
Thus an instinct would be developed which would be powerful enough,
as a rule, to prevent injurious unions. Of course it would display
itself simply as an aversion on the part of individuals to union with
others with whom they lived; but these, as a matter of fact, would
be blood-relations, so that the result would be the survival of the
fittest.

Whether man inherited the feeling from the predecessors from whom he
sprang, or whether it was developed after the evolution of distinctly
human qualities, we do not know. It must necessarily have arisen at
a stage when family ties became comparatively strong, and children
remained with their parents until the age of puberty, or even longer.
Exogamy, as a natural extension of this instinct, would arise when
single families united in small hordes. It could not but grow up if
the idea of union between persons intimately associated with one
another was an object of innate repugnance. There is no real reason
why we should assume, as so many anthropologists have done,[2054] that
primitive men lived in small endogamous communities, practising incest
in every degree. The theory does not accord with what is known of the
customs of existing savages; and it accounts for no facts which may not
be otherwise far more satisfactorily explained.

The objection will perhaps be made that the aversion to sexual
intercourse between persons living very closely together from early
youth is too complicated a mental phenomenon to be a true instinct,
acquired through spontaneous variations intensified by natural
selection. But there are instincts just as complicated as this
feeling, which, in fact, only implies that disgust is associated with
the idea of sexual intercourse between persons who have lived in a
long-continued, intimate relationship from a period of life at which
the action of desire is naturally out of the question. This association
is no matter of course, and certainly cannot be explained by the mere
liking for novelty. It has all the characteristics of a real, powerful
instinct, and bears evidently a close resemblance to the aversion to
sexual intercourse with individuals belonging to another species.

Besides the horror of incest, there is another feeling to which
reference may here be made. “L’amour,” says Bernardin de
Saint-Pierre, “ ... ne résulte que des contrastes; et plus ils sont
grands, plus il a d’énergie. C’est ce que je pourrois prouver par
mille traits d’histoire.... L’influence des contrastes en amour est si
certaine, qu’en voyant l’amant on peut faire le portrait de l’objet
aimé sans l’avoir vu, pourvu qu’on sache seulement qu’il est affecté
d’une forte passion.”[2055] Schopenhauer likewise observes that every
person requires from the individual of the opposite sex a one-sidedness
which is the opposite of his or her own. The most manly man will seek
the most womanly woman, and _vice versa_. Weak or little men have a
decided inclination for strong or big women, and strong or big women
for weak or little men. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes;
snub-nosed persons, hook-nosed; persons with excessively slim, long
bodies and limbs, those who are stumpy and short; and so on.[2056]
A similar view is held by M. Prosper Lucas, Mr. Alexander Walker,
Professor Mantegazza, Mr. Grant Allen, and other writers.[2057] “In
the love of the sexes,” says Professor Bain, “the charm of disparity
goes beyond the standing differences of sex; as in contrasts of
complexion, and of stature.”[2058]

Some writers have suggested that love thus excited by differences is
favourable to fecundity, those marriages in which it exists being more
prolific than others.[2059] Thus Mr. Andrew Knight, a most experienced
breeder, remarks, “I am disposed to think that the most powerful
human minds will be found offspring of parents of different hereditary
constitutions. I prefer a male of a different colour from the breed of
the female, where that can be obtained, and I think that I have seen
fine children produced in more than one instance, where one family
has been dark and the other fair. I am sure that I have witnessed the
bad effects of marriages between two individuals very similar to each
other in character and colour, and springing from ancestry of similar
character. Such have appeared to me to be like marriages between
brothers and sisters.”[2060]

These statements, of course, prove nothing, but they may perhaps
derive some value from the fact that they are made by so many different
observers. The statistical investigation of Professor Alphonse de
Candolle, bearing upon the same question, rests on firmer ground. He
has found, from facts collected in Switzerland, North Germany, and
Belgium, that marriages are most commonly contracted between persons
with different colours of the eye, except in the case of brown-eyed
women, who are generally considered more attractive than others.[2061]
He has noted, further, that the number of children is considerably
smaller in families where the parents have the same colour of the eye
than where the reverse is the case.[2062] But Professor Wittrock could
not, in Sweden, find any such difference in fecundity between the two
categories of marriages;[2063] and Mr. Galton observes, “Whatever may
be the sexual preferences for similarity or for contrast, I find little
indication in the average results obtained from a fairly large number
of cases, of any single measurable personal peculiarity, whether it be
stature, temper, eye-colour or artistic tastes, influencing marriage
selection to a notable degree.”[2064]

If contrasts instinctively seek each other, this may partly account
for the readiness with which love awakens love. Every one knows some
unhappy lover who has never been able to win the heart of the person
he adores; but in most cases, I should say, love is mutual. And this,
perhaps, is owing not only to the contagiousness of the passion, but
also to the attractive power of contrasts, which acts equally upon both
parties. Thus we might explain, to some extent, the extreme variation
of tastes, and the fact that, besides the general standard of beauty
common to the whole race, there exists a more detailed ideal special to
each individual.




CHAPTER XVI

SEXUAL SELECTION AS INFLUENCED BY AFFECTION AND SYMPATHY, AND BY
CALCULATION


Sexual love is the passion which unites the sexes. The stimulating
impressions produced by health, youth, and beauty, and ornaments
and other artificial means of attraction, are all elements of this
feeling. The antipathy to sexual intercourse with individuals of
another species, and the horror of incest, belong to the same
phenomenon. But the psychology of love is by no means exhausted by
this. “Simple et primitif comme toutes les forces colossales,” says
Professor Mantegazza, “l’amour paraît pourtant formé des éléments de
toutes les passions humaines.”[2065] Around the sexual appetite as the
leading element there are aggregated many different feelings, such as
admiration, pleasure of possession, love of freedom, self-esteem, and
love of approbation.[2066] A complete analysis of love would fill a
volume. Here I shall discuss only one of the most important elements of
this highly compound feeling, the sentiment of affection.

In the lower stages of human development sexual affection is much
inferior in intensity to the tender feelings with which parents
embrace their children; and among several peoples it seems to be almost
unknown. Thus, speaking of the Hovas in Madagascar, Mr. Sibree says
that, among them, until the spread of Christianity, there was “no lack
of strong affection between blood-relations—parents and children,
brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren;” but the idea of
love between husband and wife was hardly thought of.[2067] On the Gold
Coast, says Major Ellis, “love, as understood by the people of Europe,
has no existence.”[2068] At Winnebah, according to Mr. Duncan, “not
even the appearance of affection exists between husband and wife;”
and almost the same is asserted by M. Sabatier with reference to the
Kabyles, by Signor Bonfanti with reference to the Bantu race.[2069]
Munzinger says that, among the Beni-Amer, it is considered even
disgraceful for a wife to show any affection for her husband.[2070]
The Chittagong Hill tribes, according to Captain Lewin, have “no idea
of tenderness, nor of chivalrous devotion.” Marriage is among them
regarded as merely a convenient and animal connection.[2071] In the
Island of Ponapé, according to Dr. Finsch, love in our sense of the
term is entirely unknown.[2072] As regards the Eskimo of Newfoundland,
Heriot asserts, “Like all other men in the savage state, they treat
their wives with great coldness and neglect, but their affection
towards their offspring is lively and tender.”[2073] In Greenland, a
man thought nothing of beating his wife, but it was an heinous offence
for a mother to chastise her children.[2074] Almost the same is said
of the Kutchin by Mr. Jones, and of the Eskimo of Norton Sound by Mr.
Dall.[2075] According to Mr. Morgan, the refined passion of love is
unknown to the North American Indians in general.[2076]

Such statements, however, may easily be misleading. The love of a
savage is certainly very different from the love of a civilized man;
nevertheless, we may discover in it traces of the same ingredients.
There are facts which tend to show that even very rude savages may have
conjugal affection; nay, that among certain uncivilized peoples it has
reached a remarkably high degree of development.

Among the wretched Bushmans, according to Mr. Chapman, there is love
in all their marriages.[2077] Among the races of the Upper Congo, love
is ennobled by a certain poetry;[2078] and with the Touaregs, there is
a touch of almost chivalrous sentiment in the relations between men
and women.[2079] Regarding the man-eating Niam-Niam, Dr. Schweinfurth
asserts that they display an affection for their wives which is
unparalleled among other natives of an equally low grade.[2080]

The Hos are good husbands and wives, and although they have no terms
in their own language to express the higher emotions, “they feel
them all the same.”[2081] The missionary Jellinghaus found tokens of
affectionate love between married people among the Munda Kols, Mr.
Fawcett among the Savaras, Sir Spenser St. John among the Sea Dyaks,
Mr. Man among the Andamanese.[2082] In New Caledonia, says M. Moncelon,
“l’amour existe, et j’ai vu des suicides par amour.”[2083] In Samoa,
stories of affectionate love between husband and wife are preserved
in song.[2084] In Tonga, according to Mariner, most of the women
were much attached to their husbands;[2085] and in Fiji, says Dr.
Seemann, “even widowers, in the depth of their grief, have frequently
terminated their existence, when deprived of a dearly beloved
wife.”[2086] In several of the Australian tribes, married people are
often much attached to each other, and continue to be so even when they
grow old.[2087] Concerning the aborigines of Victoria, Daniel Bunce
says it is an error to suppose that there exists no settled love or
lasting affection between the sexes; among the Narrinyeri, Mr. Taplin
has known as well-matched and loving couples as he has among Europeans;
and, according to Mr. Bonney, husband and wife among the natives of the
River Darling, rarely quarrel, and “they show much affection for each
other in their own way.”[2088]

Among the Eskimo of the north-east coast of North America, visited
by Lyon, “young couples are frequently seen rubbing noses, their
favourite mark of affection, with an air of tenderness.”[2089]
The Tacullies, as Harman informs us, are remarkably fond of their
wives.[2090] And Mr. Catlin goes even so far as to deny that the
North American Indians are “in the least behind us in conjugal, in
filial, and in paternal affection,”[2091]—a statement with which Mr.
Morgan does not agree. Mr. Brett asserts that, among the natives of
Guiana, instances of conjugal attachment are very frequent.[2092] Azara
and Mantegazza found tokens of it among some other South American
tribes;[2093] and the rude Fuegians are said to “show a good deal of
affection for their wives.”[2094]

It is, indeed, impossible to believe that there ever was a time when
conjugal affection was entirely wanting in the human race. Though
originally of far less intensity than parental love, especially on the
mother’s side, as being of less importance for the existence of the
species, yet it seems, in its most primitive form, to have been as
old as marriage itself. It must be a certain degree of affection that
induces the male to defend the female during her period of pregnancy;
but often it is the joint care of the offspring, more than anything
else, that makes the married couple attached to each other. With
reference to the Dacotahs, Mr. Prescott remarks that “as children
increase, the parents appear to be more affectionate.”[2095]

Of course it is impossible to suppose that mutual love can generally
be the motive which leads to marriage when the wife is captured or
purchased from a foreign tribe. In the main, Mr. Hall’s assertion
as to the Eskimo visited by him, that “love—if it come at all—comes
after the marriage,”[2096] holds good for many savage peoples. Among
the Australians, for instance, according to Mr. Brough Smyth, love
has often no part in the preparations for marriage. “The bride is
dragged from her home—she is unwilling to leave it; and if fears are
entertained that she will endeavour to escape, a spear is thrust
through her foot or her leg. A kind husband will, however, ultimately
evoke affection, and fidelity and true love are not rare in Australian
families.”[2097]

The affection accompanying the union of the sexes has gradually
developed in proportion as altruism in general has increased. Thus
love has only slowly become the refined feeling it is in the heart of
a highly civilized European. In Eastern countries with their ancient
civilization there exists even now but little of that tenderness
towards the woman which is the principal charm of our own family life.
In China, up to recent times, it was considered “good form” for a
man to beat his wife, and, if the Chinaman of humble rank spared her
a little, he did so only in order not to come under the necessity of
buying a successor.[2098] In Hindu families, according to Dubois,
sincere mutual friendship is rarely met with. “It is in vain,” he
says, “to expect, between husband and wife, that reciprocal confidence
and kindness which constitute the happiness of a family. The object for
which a Hindu marries is not to gain a companion to aid him in enduring
the evils of life, but a slave to bear children and be subservient to
his rule.”[2099] The love of which the Persian poets sing has either
a symbolic or a very profane meaning.[2100] Among the Arabs, says
Burckhardt, “the passion of love is, indeed, much talked of by the
inhabitants of towns; but I doubt whether anything is meant by them
more than the grossest animal desire.”[2101] Mr. Finck remarks that
in the whole of the Bible there is not a single reference to romantic
love.[2102] And even in Greece, according to some authorities, the love
of the sexes was little more than sexual instinct.[2103]

It is also obvious that marriage cannot be contracted from affection
where the young women before marriage are kept quite apart from the
men, as is done in Eastern countries. In China it often happens that
the parties have not even seen each other till the wedding-day; and,
in Greece, custom was scarcely less rigorous in this respect.[2104] In
vain Plato urged that young men and women should be more frequently
permitted to meet one another, so that there should be less enmity and
indifference in the married life.[2105] Plutarch hopes that love will
come after marriage.[2106]

The feeling which makes husband and wife true companions for better and
worse can grow up only in societies where the altruistic sentiments
of man are strong enough to make him recognize woman as his equal,
and where she is not shut up as an exotic plant in a green-house, but
is allowed to associate freely with men. In this direction European
civilization has been advancing for centuries, and there can be no
reason to fear that it will ever be permanently diverted from the path
by which alone some of the most important of its ends can be attained.

When affection came to play a more prominent part in human sexual
selection, higher regard was paid to intellectual, emotional, and moral
qualities, through which the feeling is chiefly provoked. Later on, we
shall see how great are the consequences which spring from this fact.
For the present it may be enough to say that the preference given
to higher qualities by civilized men contributes much to the mental
improvement of the race. Dr. Stark observes that the intemperate,
profligate, and criminal classes do not commonly marry; and the like is
to a large extent true of persons who are very inferior in intellect,
emotions, and will.[2107]

Affection depends in a very high degree upon sympathy. Though distinct
aptitudes, these two classes of emotions are most intimately connected:
affection is strengthened by sympathy, and sympathy is strengthened by
affection. Community of interests, opinions, sentiments, culture, and
mode of life, as being essential to close sympathy,[2108] is therefore
favourable to warm affection. If love is excited by contrast, it is so
only within certain limits. The contrast must not be so great as to
exclude sympathy.

Great difference of age is fatal to close sympathy. Wieland noted that
most people who fall in love do so with persons of about their own
age;[2109] and statistics prove the observation to be correct. Men who
marry comparatively late in life usually avoid too great difference in
age.[2110] The foundation of this admiration and preference, modified
by age, says Mr. Walker, “appears to be the similarity of objects
and interests which are inseparable from similar periods of life, the
association of these with a similar intensity of sexual desire, the
consequent production of similar sympathy, and the resolve that it
shall be permanent.”[2111]

A very important factor is similarity in the degree of cultivation. It
seldom happens that a “gentleman” falls in love with a peasant-girl,
or an artizan with a “lady.” This does more than almost anything else
to maintain the separation of the different classes, and to preserve
the existing distribution of wealth among the various groups of society.

Want of sympathy prevents great divisions of human beings—such
as different races or nations, hereditary castes, classes, and
adherents of different religions—from intermarrying, even where
personal affection plays no part in the choice of the mate. Thus many
uncivilized peoples carefully avoid marrying out of their own tribe,
the chief reason being, I think, the strong dislike which distinct
savage and barbarous nations have for one another. Mr. McLennan called
such peoples “endogamous,” in contradistinction to peoples who are
“exogamous,” _i.e._, do not marry within their own tribe or clan.
But this classification has caused much confusion, “exogamy” and
“endogamy” not being real contraries. For there exists among every
people an outer circle—to use Sir Henry Maine’s very appropriate
terminology—out of which marriage is either prohibited, or generally
avoided; as well as an inner circle, including the clan, or, at any
rate, the very nearest kinsfolk, within which no marriage is allowed.

Like the inner circle, the outer circle varies considerably in extent.
Rengger states that many of the Indian races of Paraguay are too
proud to intermarry with any race of a different colour, or even of a
different stock.[2112] In Guiana and elsewhere, Indians do not readily
intermix with negroes, whom they despise.[2113] Among the Isthmians
of Central America, “marriage was not contracted with strangers or
people speaking a different language”;[2114] and in San Salvador,
according to Palacio, a man who had intercourse with a foreign woman
was killed.[2115] Mr. Powers informs us of a Californian tribe who
would put to death a woman for committing adultery with or marrying a
white man;[2116] and among the Barolongs, a Bechuana tribe, the same
punishment was formerly inflicted on any one who had intercourse with a
European.[2117] Among the Kabyles, “le mariage avec une négresse n’est
pas défendu en principe; mais la famille s’opposerait à une pareille
union.”[2118]

The Chinese, according to Mr. Jamieson, refuse marriage with the
surrounding barbarous tribes, with whom, as a rule, they have no
dealings, either friendly or hostile.[2119] The black and fairer
people of the Philippines have from time immemorial dwelt in the same
country without producing an intermediate race;[2120] the Bugis of
Perak have kept themselves very distinct from the people among whom
they live;[2121] and, in Sumatra, it is a rare thing for a Malay man to
marry a Kubu woman.[2122] The Munda Kols severely punish a girl who is
seduced by a Hindu, whereas intercourse with a man of their own people
is regarded by most of them as quite a matter of course.[2123] And,
in Ceylon, even those Veddahs who live in settlements, although they
have long associated with their neighbours, the Sinhalese, have not yet
intermarried with them.[2124]

Count de Gobineau remarks that not even a common religion and country
can extinguish the hereditary aversion of the Arab to the Turk, of
the Kurd to the Nestorian of Syria, of the Magyar to the Slav.[2125]
Indeed, so strong, among the Arabs, is the instinct of ethnical
isolation, that, as a traveller relates, at Djidda, where sexual
morality is held in little respect, a Bedouin woman may yield herself
for money to a Turk or European, but would think herself for ever
dishonoured if she were joined to him in lawful wedlock.[2126]

Marriages between Lapps and Swedes very rarely occur, being looked upon
as dishonourable by both peoples. They are equally uncommon between
Lapps and Norwegians, and it hardly ever happens that a Lapp marries
a Russian.[2127] At various times, Spaniards in Central America,
Englishmen in Mauritius, Frenchmen in Réunion and the Antilles, and
Danish traders in Greenland, have been prevented by law from marrying
natives.[2128] Among the Hebrews, during the early days of their
power and dominion, marriages with aliens seem to have been rare
exceptions.[2129] The Romans were prohibited from marrying barbarians;
Valentinian inflicted the penalty of death for such unions.[2130]
Tacitus was of opinion that the Germans refused marriage with foreign
nations,[2131] and the like seems to have been the case with the
Slavs.[2132]

Among several peoples marriage very seldom, or never, takes place even
outside the territory of the tribe or community. This is the case
with many tribes of Guatemala,[2133] the Ahts,[2134] Navajos,[2135]
and Pueblos.[2136] In the village of Schawill, in Southern Mexico,
according to Mr. Stephens, “every member must marry within the rancho,
and no such thing as a marriage out of it had ever occurred. They
said it was impossible, it could not happen.... This was a thing so
little apprehended that the punishment for it was not defined in their
penal code; but being questioned, after some consultations, they said
that the offender, whether man or woman, would be expelled.”[2137]
Speaking of the Chaymas in New Andalusia, among whom marriages are
contracted between the inhabitants of the same hamlet only,[2138]
v. Humboldt says, “Savage nations are subdivided into an infinity
of tribes, which, bearing a cruel hatred toward each other, form no
intermarriages, even when their languages spring from the same root,
and when only a small arm of a river, or a group of hills, separates
their habitations.”[2139] This holds good especially for several of
the Brazilian tribes.[2140] In ancient Peru it was not lawful for the
natives of one province or village to marry those of another.[2141]

In Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Du Chaillu, the non-cannibal
tribes do not intermarry with their cannibal neighbours, whose peculiar
practices are held in abhorrence.[2142] Barrow states that the
Hottentots always marry within their own kraal;[2143] and a Bushman
woman would regard intercourse with any one out of the tribe, no matter
how superior, as a degradation.[2144] Among the Hovas, the different
tribes, clans, and even families as a rule do not intermarry, as Mr.
Sibree says, “in order to keep landed property together, as well as
from a strong clannish feeling.”[2145] Mr. Swann informs me that, among
the Waguha, of West Tanganyika, marriages out of the tribe are avoided,
though not prohibited; and Archdeacon Hodgson writes that this is very
often the case in Eastern Central Africa.

In India there are several instances of tribe-or clan-endogamy.[2146]
The Tipperahs and Abors, for example, view with abhorrence the idea of
their girls marrying out of their own clan,[2147] and Colonel Dalton
was gravely assured that, “when one of the daughters of Pádam so
demeans herself, the sun and the moon refuse to shine, and there is
such a strife in the elements that all labour is necessarily suspended,
till by sacrifice and oblation the stain is washed away.”[2148] The
Ainos not only despise the Japanese as much as the Japanese despise
them, but are not very sociable even among themselves: one village
does not like to marry into another.[2149] The same may be said of
the Sermatta Islanders;[2150] whilst the Minahassers,[2151] the
Dyaks,[2152] and the natives of New Guinea[2153] and New Britain,[2154]
as a general rule, marry within their own tribe. Among the New
Zealanders, according to Mr. Yate, “great opposition is made to any
one taking, except for some political purpose, a wife from another
tribe,” and marriage generally takes place between relatives.[2155]
In Australia there are groups of tribes, so-called associated tribes,
generally speaking the same dialect, who are in the habit of uniting
for common defence and other purposes. Marriage between the members
of associated tribes is the rule,[2156] but many tribes are mostly
endogamous.[2157]

In ancient Wales, according to Mr. Lewis, marriage was to be within
the clan.[2158] At Athens, at least in its later history, if an alien
lived as a husband with an Athenian woman, he was liable to be sold
as a slave, and to have his property confiscated; and, if an Athenian
lived with a foreign woman, she was liable to like consequences, and he
to a penalty of a thousand drachmæ.[2159] Marriage with foreign women
was unlawful for all Spartans, and was made unlawful for the Heraclidæ
by a separate rhetra.[2160] At Rome, any marriage of a citizen with
a woman who was not herself a Roman citizen, or did not belong to a
community possessing the privilege of _connubium_ with Rome—which was
always expressly conferred—was invalid; no legitimate children could
be born of such a marriage.[2161] In early times it was even customary
for a father to seek, for his daughter, a husband from his own _gens_,
marriage out of it being mentioned as an extraordinary thing.[2162]

Prohibitions of intermarriage do not refer only to persons belonging
to different nations or tribes; very often they relate also to persons
belonging to different classes or castes of the same community. Yet
in many, perhaps most, cases these prohibitions originally coincided.
Castes are frequently, if not always, the consequences of foreign
conquest and subjugation, the conquerors becoming the nobility, and the
subjugated the commonalty or slaves. Thus, before the Norman conquest,
the English aristocracy was Saxon; after it, Norman. The descendants of
the German conquerors of Gaul were, for a thousand years, the dominant
race in France; and until the fifteenth century all the higher nobility
were of Frankish or Burgundian origin.[2163] The Sanskrit word for
caste is “varna,” _i.e._, colour, which shows how the distinction
of high and low caste arose in India. That country was inhabited by
dark races before the fairer Aryans took possession of it; and the
bitter contempt of the Aryans for foreign tribes, their domineering
spirit, and their strong antipathies of race and of religion, found
vent in the pride of class and caste distinctions. Even to this day
a careful observer can distinguish the descendants of conquerors and
conquered. “No sojourner in India,” says Dr. Stevenson, “can have
paid any attention to the physiognomy of the higher and lower orders
of natives without being struck with the remarkable difference that
exists in the shape of the head, the build of the body, and the colour
of the skin between the higher and the lower castes into which the
Hindu population is divided.”[2164] This explanation of the origin
of Indian castes is supported by the fact that it is in some of the
latest Vedic hymns that we find the earliest references to those four
classes—the Brahmans, the Kshatriyas, the Vaiśyas, and the Śudras—to
which all the later castes have been traced back.[2165] The Incas
of Peru were known as a conquering race; and the ancient Mexicans
represented the culture-heroes of the Toltecs as white.[2166] Among the
Beni-Amer, the nobles are mostly light coloured, while the commoners
are blackish.[2167] The Polynesian nobility have a comparatively fair
complexion,[2168] and seem to be the descendants of a conquering
or superior race. “The chiefs, and persons of hereditary rank and
influence in the islands,” says Ellis, “are, almost without exception,
as much superior to the peasantry or common people, in stateliness,
dignified deportment, and physical strength, as they are in rank
and circumstances; although they are not elected to their station
on account of their personal endowments, but derive their rank and
elevation from their ancestry. This is the case with most of the
groups of the Pacific, but particularly so in Tahiti and the adjacent
islands.”[2169] Among the Shans, according to Dr. Anderson, “the
majority of the higher classes seemed to be distinguished from the
common people by more elongated oval faces and a decidedly Tartar type
of countenance.”[2170] In America, at the time of the earliest European
immigration, a kind of caste distinction arose, white blood being
synonymous with nobility; and, in La Plata, Spaniards, Mestizoes, and
Indians were separated from each other even in church.[2171]

As descendants of different ancestors, members of noble families
keep up their separate position, and remain almost as foreigners to
the people among whom they live. Speculating on the want of sympathy
among the various classes in societies in which such distinctions
are recognized, Count de Tocqueville says, “Each caste has its own
opinions, feelings, rights, manners, and modes of living. Thus the
men of whom each caste is composed do not resemble the mass of their
fellow-citizens; they do not think or feel in the same manner, and they
scarcely believe that they belong to the same human race.... When the
chroniclers of the Middle Ages, who all belonged to the aristocracy by
birth or education, relate the tragical end of a noble, their grief
flows apace; whereas they tell you at a breath, and without wincing,
of massacres and tortures inflicted on the common sort of people. Not
that these writers felt habitual hatred or systematic disdain for the
people; war between the several classes of the community was not yet
declared. They were impelled by an instinct rather than by a passion;
as they had formed no clear notion of a poor man’s sufferings, they
cared but little for his fate.” Then, in proof of this, the writer
gives extracts from Madame de Sévigné’s letters, displaying a cruel
jocularity which, in our day, “the harshest man writing to the most
insensible person of his acquaintance” would not venture wantonly to
indulge in; and yet Madame de Sévigné was not selfish or cruel: she was
passionately attached to her children, and ever ready to sympathize
with her friends, and she treated her servants and vassals with
kindness and indulgence.[2172]

It is to this want of affection and sympathy between the different
layers of society, together with the vain desire of keeping the blood
pure, that the prohibition of marriage out of the class, or the general
avoidance of such marriages, owes its origin. Among the Ahts, for
instance, who take great pride in honourable birth, a patrician loses
caste unless he marries a woman of corresponding rank, in his own or
another tribe.[2173] Among the Isthmians of Central America, the lords
married only the daughters of noble blood; and, in Guatemala, marriage
with a slave reduced the freeman to a slave’s condition.[2174] The
tribes of Brazil also consider such alliances highly disgraceful.[2175]

Nowhere are the different orders of society more distinctly separated
from each other than in the South Sea Islands. In the Marianne group,
it was the common belief that only the nobles were endowed with an
immortal soul; and a nobleman who married a girl of the people was
punished with death.[2176] In Polynesia also, the commoners were looked
upon by the nobility almost as a different species of beings.[2177]
Hence in the higher ranks marriage was concluded only between persons
of corresponding position; and if, in Tahiti, a woman of condition
chose an inferior person as a husband, the children he had by her were
killed.[2178] In the Indian Archipelago, marriages between persons
of different rank are, as a rule, disapproved, and in some places
they are prohibited.[2179] Among the Hovas of Madagascar, the three
great divisions—the nobles, the commoners, and the slaves,—with few
exceptions, cannot intermarry; neither do the three different classes
of slaves marry each other.[2180] Almost the same rule holds good for
the different orders of the Beni-Amer and Marea;[2181] whilst, among
the Tedâ, the smiths form an hereditary and utterly despised caste by
themselves, being obliged to marry solely with members of their own
caste.[2182] By several African peoples, however, slaves and freemen
are allowed to intermarry.[2183]

The Aenezes of Arabia never intermarry with the “szona,”
handicraftsmen or artizans; nor do they ever marry their daughters to
Fellahs, or to inhabitants of towns.[2184] In India, intermarriage
between different castes was in Manu’s time permissible, but is now
altogether prohibited. Of the original four castes, the Brahmans
alone have retained their purity to any extent, but there is an almost
endless number of trade-castes, resulting chiefly from associations
of men engaged in the same occupation.[2185] Moreover, as Sir Monier
Williams remarks, “we find castes within castes, so that even the
Brahmans are broken up and divided into numerous races, which again
are subdivided into numerous tribes, families, or sub-castes ... which
do not intermarry.”[2186] Class-endogamy prevails in Ceylon,[2187]
Siam,[2188] and Corea;[2189] and in the Chittagong district, when a
slave marries, the person chosen must be a slave.[2190] In China,
play-actors, policemen, boatmen, and slaves are not allowed to
marry women of any other class than that to which they respectively
belong.[2191] And in Japan, before the year 1868, when a new order
of things was introduced, the different classes of nobles were not
permitted to intermarry with each other or with common people.[2192]

In Europe there have been similar prohibitions. In Rome, plebeians
and patricians could not intermarry till the year 455 B.C., nor were
marriages allowed between patricians and clients. Cicero himself
disapproved of intermarriages of _ingenui_ and freedmen, and, though
such alliances were generally permitted under the Emperors, yet a
senator could not marry a freed-woman, nor a patroness her liberated
slave. Between freemen and slaves _contubernium_ could take place, but
not marriage.[2193] Among the Teutonic peoples, in ancient times, any
freeman who had intercourse with a slave was punished with slavery, and
a woman guilty of such a crime might be killed. In the Scandinavian
countries, slavery came to an end at a comparatively early period, but
in Germany it was succeeded by serfdom; and equality of birth continued
to be regarded as an indispensable condition of lawful marriage. As
late as the thirteenth century any German woman who had intercourse
with a serf lost her liberty.[2194] From the class of freemen, both
in Germany and in Scandinavia, the nobility gradually emerged as a
distinct order, and marriages between persons of noble birth and
persons who, although free, were not noble, came to be considered
misalliances.[2195] In Sweden, in the seventeenth century, such
marriages were punished.[2196]

Modern civilization tends to pull down the barriers which separate
the various classes of society, just as it tends to diminish the
differences in interests, habits, sentiments, and knowledge. Birth no
longer determines to the same extent as before a man’s social position,
and nobility has become a shadow of what it was. Thus there survive
but few traces of the former class-endogamy. According to German Civil
Law, the marriage of a man belonging to the high nobility with a woman
of inferior birth is still regarded as a _disparagium_; and the woman
is not entitled to the rank of her husband, nor is the full right of
inheritance possessed by her or by her children.[2197] Although in
no way prevented by law, marriages out of the class are generally
avoided by custom. “The outer or endogamous limit, within which a man
or woman must marry,” says Sir Henry Maine, “has been mostly taken
under the shelter of fashion or prejudice. It is but faintly traced in
England, though not wholly obscured. It is (or perhaps was) rather more
distinctly marked in the United States, through prejudices against the
blending of white and coloured blood. But in Germany certain hereditary
dignities are still forfeited by a marriage beyond the forbidden
limits; and in France, in spite of all formal institutions, marriages
between a person belonging to the _noblesse_ and a person belonging
to the _bourgeoisie_ (distinguished roughly from one another by the
particle ‘de’) are wonderfully rare, though they are not unknown.[2198]

Different nations, like the different classes of society, have been
gradually drawing nearer to each other. National prejudices have
diminished, and international sympathy has increased. During the
Middle Ages a foreigner was called in Germany “ein Elender,” because
he stood outside the law;[2199] to-day he enjoys the protection of
the law in all civilized countries, and is not as a foreigner an
object of prejudice. This widening of sympathy, and improved means of
communication, have of course made intermarriages between the several
nations much more common than they used to be.

Religion, finally, has formed a great bar to intermarriage. In British
India, the descendants of all the Mohammedan races—Arab, Iranian,
Turanian, Mongol, and Hindu converts—intermarry, but there are few
unions between Christian men and Mohammedan women.[2200] Indeed,
according to Mr. Lane, such a marriage is not permitted under any
circumstances, and cannot take place otherwise than by force. On the
other hand, it is held lawful for a Mohammedan to marry a Christian or
a Jewish woman, if induced to do so by excessive love of her, or if he
cannot obtain a wife of his own religion. In this case, however, the
offspring must follow the father’s faith, and the wife does not inherit
when the husband dies.[2201] Marriage with a heathen woman is never
permitted to a Mussulman.[2202]

It is mainly religion that has kept the Jews a relatively pure race.
“The Jew,” says Dr. Neubauer, “has no preference for, or any aversion
from, one race or another, provided he can marry a woman of his
religion, and _vice versa_.”[2203] Indeed, the Jewish law does not
recognize marriage with a person of another belief,[2204] though there
are instances of such marriages in the early days of Israel.[2205]
During the Middle Ages, marriage between Jews and Christians was
prohibited by the Christians also, and universally avoided.[2206]
“The folk-lore of Europe,” Mr. Jacobs remarks, “regarded the Jews as
something infra-human, and it would require an almost impossible amount
of large toleration for a Christian maiden of the Middle Ages to regard
union with a Jew as anything other than unnatural.” Mr. Jacobs thinks
it may be doubted whether even at the present day there is one mixed
marriage to five hundred pure Jewish marriages.[2207]

St. Paul indicates that a Christian was not allowed to marry a
heathen,[2208] and Tertullian calls such an alliance fornication.[2209]
In early times, the Church often encouraged marriages of this sort as
a means of propagating Christianity, and it was only when its success
was beyond doubt that it actually prohibited them.[2210] The Council
of Elvira expressly forbade Christian parents to give their daughters
in marriage to heathens, ordering that those who did so should be
excommunicated.[2211]

Even the adherents of different Christian confessions have been
prohibited from intermarrying. In the Roman Church the prohibition of
marriage with heathens and Jews (_impedimentum cultus disparitatis_)
was soon followed by the prohibition of “mixed marriages”
(_impedimentum mixtae religionis_); and the Protestants also originally
forbade such unions. The Greek Church, on the other hand, made in this
respect a distinction between _schismatici_, or those who dissent from
the Church in non-essential points only, and _haeretici_, or those who
dissent from its fundamental doctrines.[2212] Mixed marriages are not
now contrary to the civil law either in Roman Catholic or in Protestant
countries; but in countries belonging to the Orthodox Greek Church the
ecclesiastical restrictions have been adopted by the State. In Russia,
Greece, and Servia, Roman Catholics and Protestants are regarded as
_schismatici_ but in the Turkish countries as _haeretici_.[2213] It is
noteworthy that, in countries which are partly Roman Catholic, partly
Protestant, mixed marriages form only a comparatively small percentage
of the whole number of marriages.[2214]

In no respect has modern civilization acted more beneficently than as
a promoter of religious toleration. In our time difference of faith
discourages sympathy to a much less extent than it did in former ages.
Hence the number of mixed marriages everywhere tends to increase. In
Bavaria, for instance, they amounted in 1835-1850 to 2·8 per cent.
of the whole number of marriages, in 1850-1860 to 3·6 per cent., in
1860-1870 to 4·4 per cent., in 1870-1875 to 5·6 per cent., and in
1876-1877 to 6·6 per cent.[2215]

While, therefore, civilization has narrowed the inner limit, within
which a man or woman must not marry, it has widened the outer limit
within which a man or woman _may_ marry, and generally marries.
The latter of these processes has been one of vast importance in
man’s history. Originating in race-or caste-pride, or in religious
intolerance, the endogamous rules have, in their turn, helped to keep
up and strengthen these feelings. Law is by nature conservative,
maintaining sentiments developed under past conditions. It is only
by slow degrees that the ideas of a new time become strong enough to
release mankind from ancient prejudices.

       *       *       *       *       *

We have hitherto dealt only with the poetry of sexual selection—love;
now something is to be said of its prose—dry calculation. And we may
conveniently begin with man’s appreciation of woman’s fertility,
as this has some of the characteristics of an instinct. Desire for
offspring is universal in mankind. Abortion, indeed, is practised now
and then, and infanticide frequently takes place among many savage
peoples; but these facts do not disprove the general rule.

Speaking of the Crees, Chippewyans, and other Indians on the eastern
side of the Rocky Mountains, Harmon says that “all Indians are
very desirous of having a numerous offspring.”[2216] Among the
Ingaliks, “children are anxiously desired, even when women have
no husbands.”[2217] Among the Mayas, disappointed couples prayed
earnestly, and brought many offerings to propitiate the god whose
anger was supposed to have deferred their hopes.[2218] “Be numerous
in offspring and descendants,” is a frequent marriage benediction or
salutation in Madagascar; for to die without posterity is looked upon
as a great calamity, and is termed “dead as regards the eye.”[2219] A
negro considers childlessness the greatest disaster which can happen
to him;[2220] Bosman once asked one of the king’s captains in Fida how
many children he had, and he answered, sighing, that he was so unhappy
as not to have many—he could not pretend to have had above seventy,
including those who were dead. Among the Waganda and Wanyoro, great
rejoicings take place in the case of the birth of twins.[2221] The
Shaman heathens of Siberia regarded an abundance of children and cattle
as the most essential condition of a man’s happiness.[2222] “Honest
people have many children,” a Japanese proverb says;[2223] the Chinese
regard a large family of sons as a mark of the divine favour;[2224]
and to become the father of a son is described in Indian poems as the
greatest happiness which may fall to the share of a mortal.[2225] In
Persia, childlessness is considered the most horrible calamity.[2226]
One of the chief blessings that Moses in the name of God promised the
Israelites was a numerous progeny; and the ancient Romans regarded the
procreation of legitimate children as the real end of marriage.[2227]
“He who has no children, has no happiness either,” the South
Slavonians say;[2228] and German folk-lore compares a marriage without
offspring with a world without sun.[2229]

A woman therefore is valued not only as a wife but as a mother.
Nowhere has greater stress been laid on this idea than in ancient
Lacedaemon. A husband, if he considered that the unfruitfulness of
the marriage was owing to himself, gave his matrimonial rights to a
younger man, whose child then belonged to the husband’s family; and
to the wives of men who, for example, fell in battle before having
children, other men, probably slaves, were assigned, that there might
be heirs and successors to the deceased husband.[2230] Among many
peoples the respect in which a woman is held is proportionate to
her fecundity,[2231] and a barren wife is frequently despised as an
unnatural and useless being.[2232] In Angola, according to Livingstone,
in the native dances, “when any one may wish to deride another, in the
accompanying song a line is introduced, 'So and so has no children, and
never will get any.’” The offended woman feels the insult so keenly
that it is not uncommon for her to rush away and commit suicide.[2233]
Among the Creeks, a man always calls his wife his son’s mother;[2234]
and, among the Todas, in addressing a man with the casual question,
“Are you married?” the ordinary way of putting it would be to say,
“Is there a son?”[2235]

It is obvious, then, that fecundity must be one of the qualities which
a man most eagerly requires from his bride. Mr. Reade tells us that,
in certain parts of Africa, especially in malarious localities, where
women are so frequently sterile, no one cares to marry a girl till she
has borne a child; and among the Votyaks, according to Dr. Buch, a girl
gets married sooner if she is a mother.[2236]

We have seen several instances of husband and wife not living together
as married people before the birth of a child. Among the Creeks,
marriages were contracted for a year, but if they proved fruitful,
they were, as a rule, renewed.[2237] Again, with regard to an order of
the Essenes, Josephus states that, considering succession to be the
principal part of human life, they tried their spouses for three years,
and then married them only if there was a prospect of the union being
fruitful.[2238] Among many peoples it is the practice for a man to
repudiate a barren wife.

The desire for offspring, with its consequence, the appreciation of
female fecundity, is due to various causes. First, there is in man
an instinct for reproduction. Mr. Marshall remarks, “Of this desire
for progeny I have seen many examples amongst the Todas, so strongly
marked, but to all appearances apart from the sense of personal
ambition, and separate from any demands of religion or requirements for
support in old age, as to give the impression that it was the primitive
faculty of Philoprogenitiveness, acting so insensibly, naturally, as
to have the character more of a plain instinct, than of an intelligent
human feeling.”[2239] With this instinct a feeling of parental pride
is associated. “Children,” says Hobbes, “are a man’s power and his
honour.”[2240]

Among the Hebrews and the ancient Aryan nations, the desire for
offspring, particularly sons, had its root chiefly in religious belief,
being a natural outcome of the idea that the spirits of the dead were
made happy by homage received at the hands of their male posterity.
The same is the case with the Chinese[2241] and Japanese,[2242] and
perhaps, to a certain extent, with some peoples at a lower stage of
civilization. The savage believes that the life which goes on after
death, differs in nothing from this life, that wants and pursuits
remain as before, that consequently the dead man’s spirit eats and
drinks, and needs fire for warmth and cooking. It is, of course, his
surviving descendants who have to see that he is well provided for in
these respects. Hence the offerings to deceased ancestors for various
periods after death and the feasts for the dead.[2243] Among the
Thlinkets according to Holmberg, it sometimes happens that a man spends
his whole fortune as well as his wife’s marriage portion on such a
feast, and has to live as a poor man for the rest of his life.[2244]

But no doubt children are most eagerly longed for by savage men because
they are of use to him in his lifetime. They are easily supported when
young, and in times of want they may be left to die or be sold. When
a few years old, the sons become able to hunt, fish, and paddle, and
later on they are their father’s companions in war. The daughters help
their mother to provide food, and, when grown up, they are lucrative
objects of trade. Finally, when old, the parents would often suffer
want had they not their children to support them.[2245] Hence, in
a savage condition of life, children are the chief wealth of the
family. And the same is the case at somewhat higher stages of social
development. Mr. Lane remarks that, in Egypt, “at the age of five or
six years, the children become of use to tend the flocks and herds; and
at a more advanced age, until they marry, they assist their fathers in
the operations of agriculture. The poor in Egypt have often to depend
entirely upon their sons for support in their old age; but many parents
are deprived of these aids, and consequently reduced to beggary, or
almost to starvation.”[2246] To a certain extent, this holds good for
the uneducated classes in Europe also.

With the progress of civilization the desire for offspring has
become less intense. The religious motive has of course died out in
the Christian world, and, in proportion as social life becomes more
complicated, and a professional education becomes more necessary for
success in the struggle for existence, children, at least in “the
upper classes” and among towns-people, put their parents to expense
instead of being a source of wealth. A childless couple may indeed,
deplore the absence of children; but a woman is no longer held in
respect only, or principally, as a mother; and marriage, according to
modern ideas, is something more than an institution for the procreation
of legitimate offspring. Yet it is remarkable that, in Switzerland,
although barrenness is no sufficient reason for a man to repudiate his
wife, two-fifths of the total number of divorces take place between
married people who have no children whilst the sterile marriages amount
only to one-fifth of the number of marriages.[2247]

A wife is of use to her husband not merely because she gives him
labourers, but also because she herself is a labourer. Drying
and preparing fish and meat, lighting and attending to the fire,
transporting baggage, picking berries, dressing hides and making
clothes, cooking food and taking care of the children—these are, in
the savage state, the chief pursuits of a wife. Among agricultural
and cattle-farming peoples, she has besides, to cultivate the soil
and to tend the cattle. A wife, therefore, is chosen partly because
of her ability to perform such duties. Thus, among the Greenlanders,
cleverness in sewing and skill in the management of household affairs
are the most attractive qualities of a woman.[2248] Among other Eskimo
tribes and in Tierra del Fuego, middle-aged men will connect themselves
with old women who are best able to take care of their common
comforts.[2249] The Inland Columbians, according to Mr. Bancroft, make
“capacity for work the standard of female excellence;”[2250] and,
among the Turkomans, young widows fetch double the price of spinsters,
because they are more accustomed to hard labour, and more experienced
in household concerns.[2251]

A husband’s function is to protect his family from enemies and to
prevent them falling into distress. A woman, as we have already seen,
even instinctively prefers a courageous and strong man to one who is
cowardly and feeble. But reflection also makes her choose a man who
is well able to defend her and to provide food. Among the Comanches,
says Mr. Parker, “young girls are not averse to marry very old men,
particularly if they are chiefs, as they are always sure of something
to eat.”[2252]

At more advanced stages of civilization, money and inherited property
often take the place of skill, strength, and working ability. Thus,
wife-purchase and husband-purchase, still persist in modern society,
though in disguised forms.




CHAPTER XVII

MARRIAGE BY CAPTURE AND MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE


The practice of capturing wives prevails in various parts of the world,
and traces of it are met with in the marriage ceremonies of several
peoples, indicating that it occurred much more frequently in past ages.

Speaking of the inhabitants of Unimak, Coxe says that they invaded the
other Aleutian islands, and carried off women—the chief object of their
incursions.[2253] Among the Ahts, a man occasionally steals a wife
from the women of his own tribe;[2254] whilst the Bonaks of California
usually take women in battle from other tribes, and the Macas Indians
of Ecuador acquire wives by purchase, if the woman belongs to the
same tribe, but otherwise by force.[2255] All the Carib tribes used
to capture women from different peoples and tribes, so that the men
and women nowhere spoke the same tongue;[2256] and v. Martius states
that, in Brazil, “some tribes habitually steal their neighbours’
daughters.”[2257]

Among the Mosquito Indians, after the wedding is all arranged and
the presents paid, the bridegroom seizes his bride and carries her
off, followed by her female relatives, who pretend to try to rescue
her.[2258] The Araucanians considered the carrying off of the bride by
pretended violence an essential prerequisite to the nuptials, and,
according to Mr. E. R. Smith, it is even “a point of honour with the
bride to resist and struggle, however willing she may be.”[2259] The
Uaupés “have no particular ceremony at their marriages, except that of
always carrying away the girl by force, or making a show of doing so,
even when she and her parents are quite willing.”[2260] Almost the same
is said of the Fuegians, though among them the capture is sometimes
more than a ceremony.[2261]

Andersson remarks that, among the Bushmans, woman is only too often
_belli teterrima causa_.[2262] Speaking of the Bechuanas, Mr. Conder
says, “As regards wedding ceremonies, there is one of casting an
arrow into the hut by the bridegroom, which is worthy of notice
as symbolic.”[2263] Among the Wakamba, marriage is an affair of
purchase, but the bridegroom “must then carry off the bride by force
or stratagem.”[2264] The Wa-taïta and Wa-chaga of Eastern Equatorial
Africa have also a marriage ceremony of capture;[2265] and the like is
the case with the Inland Negroes mentioned by Lord Kames,[2266] and the
Abyssinians.[2267] Among the tribes of Eastern Central Africa described
by Mr. Macdonald, marriage by capture occurs not as a symbol only.[2268]

According to a common belief, the Australian method of obtaining
wives is capture in its most brutal form.[2269] But contrary to Mr.
Howitt,[2270] Mr. Curr informs us that only on rare occasions is a wife
captured from another tribe, and carried off.[2271] The possession of
a stolen woman would lead to constant attacks, hence the tribes set
themselves very generally against the practice.[2272] Even elopements,
according to Mr. Mathew, are now usually more fictitious than
real;[2273] but there are strong reasons for believing that formerly,
when the continent was only partially occupied, elopements from within
the tribe frequently occurred.[2274]

In Tasmania the capture of women for wives from hostile and alien
tribes was generally prevalent.[2275] Among the Maoris, the ancient and
most general way of obtaining a wife was for the man to get together
a party of his friends and carry off the woman by force, apparent or
actual.[2276] A similar practice occurs on the larger islands of the
Fiji Group,[2277] in Samoa,[2278] Tukopia,[2279] New Guinea,[2280]
and extremely frequently in the Indian Archipelago,[2281] and among
the wild tribes of India.[2282] Among the Arabs,[2283] Tartars,[2284]
and other peoples of Central Asia, as also in European Russia,[2285]
traces of capture occur in the marriage ceremony, whilst the
Tangutans,[2286] Samoyedes,[2287] Votyaks,[2288] &c.,[2289] are still
in the habit of stealing wives, or elope with their sweethearts, if
the bridegroom cannot afford to pay the fixed purchase-sum. Among
the Laplanders,[2290] Esthonians,[2291] and Finns,[2292] marriage
by capture occurred in former days, and in some parts of Finland
symbolical traces of it in the marriage ceremony have been found in
modern times.[2293]

The same practice prevailed among the peoples of the Aryan race.
According to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ one of the eight legal forms of
the marriage ceremony was the Râkshasa rite, _i.e._, “the forcible
abduction of a maiden from her home, while she cries out and weeps,
after her kinsmen have been slain or wounded, and their houses broken
open.” This rite was permitted for the Kshatriyas by the sacred
tradition.[2294] According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, marriage by
capture was at one time customary throughout ancient Greece;[2295]
and, as Plutarch informs us, it was retained by the Spartans as an
important symbol in the marriage ceremony.[2296] Even now, according
to Sakellarios, capture of wives occasionally occurs in Greece.[2297]
Among the Romans, the bride fled to the lap of her mother, and was
carried off by force by the bridegroom and his friends.[2298] In the
historical age this was a ceremony only, but at an earlier time the
capture seems to have been a reality. “Les premiers Romains,” says
M. Ortolan, “d’après leurs traditions héroïques, ont été obligés
de recourir à la surprise et à la force pour enlever leurs premières
femmes.”[2299] The ancient Teutons frequently captured women for
wives.[2300] Speaking of the Scandinavian nations, Olaus Magnus says
that they were continually at war with one another, “propter raptas
virgines aut arripiendas.”[2301] Among the Welsh, on the morning of the
wedding-day, the bridegroom, accompanied by his friends on horseback,
carried off the bride.[2302] The Slavs in early times, according to
Nestor, practised marriage by capture;[2303] and in the marriage
ceremonies of the Russians and other Slavonian nations, reminiscences
of this custom still survive.[2304] Indeed, among the South Slavonians,
capture _de facto_ was in full force no longer ago than the beginning
of the present century.[2305] According to Olaus Magnus, it prevailed
in Muscovy, Lithuania, and Livonia;[2306] and, according to Seignior
de Gaya, the symbol of it occurred in his time in Poland, Prussia, and
Samogithia.[2307]

The list of peoples among whom marriage by capture occurs, either as
a reality or as a symbol, might easily be enlarged.[2308] There are
peoples, however, who seem to have nothing of the kind. As regards the
Chinese, Mr. Jamieson says, “Of the capture of wives there is, as far
as I am aware, historically no trace, nor is the form to be found among
any of the ceremonies of marriage with which I am acquainted.”[2309]
Moreover, it is doubtful whether the ceremonies given as instances of
symbolical capture are, in every case, survivals of capture _de facto_,
in the real sense of the term, that is, taking the woman against not
only her own will, but that of her parents. Mr. Spencer suggests
that one origin of the form of capture may be the resistance of the
pursued woman, due to coyness, partly real and partly assumed;[2310]
and, though this suggestion has been much attacked, it can scarcely be
disproved. On the East Coast of Greenland, according to Dr. Nansen,
the only method of contracting a marriage is still for the man to
go to the girl’s tent, catch her by the hair or anything else which
offers a hold, and drag her off to his dwelling without further ado.
Violent scenes are often the result, as single women always affect the
utmost bashfulness and aversion to any proposal of marriage, lest they
should lose their reputation for modesty. But “the woman’s relations
meanwhile stand quietly looking on, as the struggle is considered a
purely private affair, and the natural desire of the Greenlander to
stand on a good footing with his neighbour prevents him from attempting
any interference with another’s business.”[2311] Again, according to
Mr. Abercromby, marriage _with_ capture—by which he understands capture
of a bride, associated with some other form of marriage, such as that
by purchase—may be regarded rather as a result of the innate universal
desire to display courage, than as a survival of a still older practice
of taking women captive in time of war.[2312]

Mr. McLennan thinks that marriage by capture arose from the rule of
exogamy. But there are peoples—the Maoris, Ahts, &c.—among whom this
practice occurs or has remained as a symbol, who are, nevertheless,
what Mr. McLennan would call endogamous. We are not entitled to say
that, “wherever exogamy can be found, we may confidently expect
to find, after due investigation, at least traces of a system of
capture.”[2313] On reckoning up the peoples among whom the combination
of capture and exogamy is met with, Dr. Tylor observes that the number,
“though enough to show that they coexist freely, falls short of what
would justify the inference that they are cause and effect.”[2314]

It seems to me extremely probable that the practice of capturing
women for wives is due chiefly to the aversion to close
intermarriage—existing, as we have seen, among endogamous tribes
also,—together with the difficulty a savage man has in procuring a
wife in a friendly manner, without giving compensation for the loss
he inflicts on her father. Being something quite different from the
wrestling for wives, already mentioned as the most primitive method
of courtship, marriage by capture flourished at that stage of social
growth when family ties had become stronger, and man lived in small
groups of nearly related persons, but when the idea of barter had
scarcely occurred to his mind.[2315] From the universality of the
horror of incest, and from the fact that primitive hordes were in a
chronic state of warfare with one another, the general prevalence of
this custom may be easily explained. But as it is impossible to believe
that there ever was a time when friendly negotiations between families
who could intermarry were altogether unknown, we cannot suppose that
capture was at any period the exclusive form of contracting marriage,
although it may have been the normal form. In Australia, where
marriage by capture takes place between members of hostile communities
only,[2316] we are aware of no tribe—exogamous or endogamous—living in
a state of absolute isolation. On the contrary, every tribe entertains
constant relations, for the most part amicable, with one, two, or
more tribes; and marriages between their members are the rule.[2317]
Moreover, the custom, prevalent among many savage tribes, of a husband
taking up his abode in his wife’s family seems to have arisen very
early in man’s history. And Dr. Tylor’s schedules show that there are
in different parts of the world even twelve or thirteen well-marked
exogamous peoples among whom this habit occurs.[2318]

       *       *       *       *       *

As appears from the instances quoted, the practice of capturing wives
is, in the main, a thing of the past. Among most existing uncivilized
peoples a man has, in some way or other, to give compensation for his
bride.[2319] Marriage by capture has been succeeded by marriage by
purchase.

The simplest way of purchasing a wife is no doubt to give a kinswoman
in exchange for her. “The Australian male,” says Mr. Curr, “almost
invariably obtains his wife or wives, either as a survivor of a
married brother, or in exchange for his sisters, or later on in life
for his daughters.”[2320] A similar exchange is sometimes effected in
Sumatra.[2321]

Much more common is the custom of obtaining a wife by services rendered
to her father. The man goes to live with the family of the girl for a
certain time, during which he works as a servant. This practice, with
which Hebrew tradition has familiarized us, is widely diffused among
the uncivilized races of America,[2322] Africa,[2323] Asia,[2324] and
the Indian Archipelago.[2325] Often it is only those men who are too
poor to pay cash that serve in the father-in-law’s house till they have
given an equivalent in labour; but sometimes not even money can save
the bridegroom from this sort of servitude.[2326] In some cases he has
to serve his time before he is allowed to marry the girl; in others he
gets her in advance. Again, among several peoples, already mentioned,
the man goes over to the woman’s family or tribe to live there for
ever; but Dr. Starcke suggests that this custom has a different origin
from the other, being an expression of the strong clan sentiment, and
not a question of gain.[2327]

According to Mr. Spencer, the obtaining of wives by services
rendered, instead of by property paid, constitutes a higher form
of marriage, and is developed along with the industrial type of
society. “This modification,” he says, “practicable with difficulty
among rude predatory tribes becomes more practicable as there arise
established industries affording spheres in which services may be
rendered.”[2328] But it should be noticed that, even at a very low
stage of civilization, a man may help his father-in-law in fishing and
hunting, whilst industrial work promotes accumulation of property, and
consequently makes it easier for the man to acquire his wife by real
purchase. We find also the practice of serving for wives prevalent
among such rude races as the Fuegians and the Bushmans; and, in the
‘Eyrbyggja Saga,’ Vîgstyr says to the berserk Halli, who asked for the
hand of his daughter Âsdî, “As you are a poor man, I shall do as the
ancients did and let you deserve your marriage by hard work.”[2329] It
seems then, almost probable that marriage by services is a more archaic
form than marriage by purchase; but generally they occur simultaneously.

The most common compensation for a bride is property paid to her owner.
Her price varies indefinitely. A pretty, healthy, and able-bodied girl
commands of course a better price than one who is ugly and weak;[2330]
a girl of rank, a better price than one who is mean and poor;[2331] a
virgin, generally a better than a widow or a repudiated wife.[2332]
Among the Californian Karok, for instance, a wife is seldom purchased
for less than half a string of dentalium shell, but “when she
belongs to an aristocratic family, is pretty, and skillful in making
acorn-bread and weaving baskets, she sometimes costs as high as two
strings.”[2333] The bride-price however, varies most according to the
circumstances of the parties, and according to the value set on female
labour. In British Columbia and Vancouver Island, the value of the
articles given for the bride ranges from £20 to £40 sterling.[2334]
The Indians of Oregon buy their wives for horses, blankets, or buffalo
robes.[2335] Among the Shastika in California, “a wife is purchased
of her father for shell-money or horses, ten or twelve cayuse ponies
being paid for a maid of great attractions.”[2336] Again, the Navajos
of New Mexico consider twelve horses so exorbitant a price for a wife,
that it is paid only for “one possessing unusual qualifications, such
as beauty, industry, and skill in their necessary employments”;[2337]
and the Patagonians give mares, horses, or silver ornaments for the
bride.[2338]

In Africa, not horses but cattle are considered the most proper
equivalent for a good wife. Among the Kaffirs, three, five, or ten
cows are a low price, twenty or thirty a rather high; but, according
to Barrow, a man frequently obtained a wife for an ox or a couple of
cows.[2339] The Damaras are so poor a people that they are often glad
to take one cow for a daughter.[2340] Among the Banyai, many heads of
cattle or goats are given to induce the parents of the girl “to give
her up,” as it is termed, _i.e._, to forgo all claim on her offspring,
for if nothing is given, the family from which she comes can claim
the children as part of itself.[2341] In Uganda, the ordinary price
of a wife is either three or four bullocks, six sewing needles, or a
small box of percussion caps, but Mr. Wilson was often offered one in
exchange for a coat or a pair of shoes.[2342] In the Mangoni country,
two skins of a buck are considered a fair price,[2343] and among the
Negroes of Bondo, a goat;[2344] whereas, among the Mandingoes, as
we are told by Caillié, no wife is to be had otherwise than by the
presentation of slaves to the parents of the mistress.[2345]

The Chulims paid from five to fifty roubles for a wife, the Turalinzes
usually from five to ten.[2346] Rich Bashkirs pay sometimes even
3,000 roubles, but the poorest may buy a wife for a cart-load of wood
or hay.[2347] In Tartary, parents sell a daughter for some horses,
oxen, sheep, or pounds of butter; among the Samoyedes and Ostyaks,
for a certain number of reindeer.[2348] Among the Indian Kisáns,
“two baskets of rice and a rupee in cash constitute the compensatory
offering given to the parents of the girl.”[2349] Among the Mishmis, a
rich man gives for a wife twenty mithuns (a kind of oxen), but a poor
man can get a wife for a pig.[2350] In Timor-laut, according to Mr.
Forbes, “no wife can be purchased without elephants’ tusks.”[2351]
In the Caroline Islands, “the man makes a present to the father of
the girl whom he marries, consisting of fruits, fish, and similar
things!”[2352] In Samoa, the bride-price included canoes, pigs, and
foreign property of any kind which might fall into their hands;[2353]
and, among the Fijians, “the usual price is a whale’s tooth, or a
musket.”[2354]

Among some peoples marriage may take place on credit, though,
generally, the wife and her children cannot leave the parental home
until the price is paid in full.[2355] In Unyoro, according to Emin
Pasha, when a poor man is unable to procure the cattle required for
his marriage at once, he may, by agreement with the bride’s father,
pay them by instalments; the children, however, born in the meantime
belong to the wife’s father, and each of them must be redeemed with a
cow.[2356]

Marriage by exchange or purchase is not only generally prevalent among
existing lower races; it occurs, or formerly occurred, among civilized
nations as well. In Central America and Peru, a man had to serve for
his bride.[2357] In China, a present is given by the father of the
suitor, the amount of which is not left to the goodwill of the parties,
as the term “present” would suggest, but is exactly stipulated for
by the negotiators of the marriage; hence, as Mr. Jamieson remarks,
it is no doubt a survival of the time when the transaction was one of
ordinary bargain.[2358] In Japan, the proposed husband sends certain
prescribed presents to his future bride, and this sending of presents
forms one of the most important parts of the marriage ceremony. In
fact, when once the presents have been sent and accepted, the contract
is completed, and neither party can retract. Mr. Küchler says he has
been unable to find out the exact meaning of these presents: the
native books on marriage are silent on the subject, and the Japanese
themselves have no other explanation to give than that the custom has
been handed down from ancient times.[2359] But from the facts recorded
in the next chapter it is evident that the sending of presents is a
relic of a previous custom of marrying by purchase.

In all branches of the Semitic race men had to buy or serve for
their wives, the “mohar” or “mahr” being originally the same as a
purchase-sum.[2360] In the Books of Ruth and Hosea, the bridegroom
actually says that he has bought the bride;[2361] and the modern
Jews, according to Michaelis, have a sham purchase among their
marriage ceremonies, which is called “marrying by the penny.”[2362]
In Mohammedan countries marriage differs but little from a real
purchase.[2363] The same custom prevailed among the Chaldeans,
Babylonians,[2364] and Assyrians.[2365]

Speaking of the ancient Finns, the Finnish philologist and traveller,
Castrén, remarks, “There are many reasons for believing that a cap
full of silver and gold was one of the best proxies in wooing among our
ancestors.”[2366] Evident traces of marriage by purchase are, indeed,
found in the ‘Kalevala’ and the ‘Kanteletar’;[2367] and, in parts of
Finland, symbols of it are still left in the marriage ceremony.[2368]
Among the East Finnish peoples, marriage by purchase exists even now,
or did so till quite lately.[2369]

Wife purchase, as Dr. Winternitz remarks, was the basis of
Indo-European marriage before the separation of peoples took
place.[2370] The Hindu bride, in Vedic times, had to be won by rich
presents to the future father-in-law;[2371] and one of the eight
forms of marriage mentioned, though disapproved of, by Manu—the Âsura
form—was marriage by purchase. According to Dubois, to marry and to
buy a wife are in India synonymous terms.[2372] Aristotle tells us
that the ancient Greeks were in the habit of purchasing wives,[2373]
and in the Homeric age a maid was called “ἀλφεσίβοια,” _i.e._, one
“who yields her parents many oxen as presents from her suitor.”
Among the Thracians, according to Herodotus, marriage was contracted
by purchase.[2374] So also throughout Teutonic antiquity.[2375] The
ancient Scandinavians believed that even the gods had bought their
wives.[2376] In Germany, the expression “to purchase a wife” was in
use till the end of the Middle Ages, and we find the same term in
Christian IV.'s Norwegian Law of 1604.[2377] As late as the middle of
the sixteenth century the English preserved in their marriage ritual
traces of this ancient legal procedure;[2378] whilst in Thuringia,
according to Franz Schmidt, the betrothal ceremony even to this day
indicates its former occurrence.[2379]

Purchase, as Dr. Schrader remarks, cannot with equal certainty be
established as the oldest form of marriage on Roman soil.[2380] But
the symbolical process of _coemptio_—the form of marriage among the
plebeians—preserved a reminiscence of the original custom in force
if not at Rome, at least among the ancestors of the Romans.[2381] In
Ireland and Wales, in ancient times, the bride-price consisted usually
of articles of gold, silver, and bronze, sometimes even of land.[2382]
The Slavs, also, used to buy their wives;[2383] and, among the South
Slavonians, the custom of purchasing the bride still partially
prevails, or recently did so. In Servia, at the beginning of the
present century, the price of girls reached such a height that Black
George limited it to one ducat.[2384]

In spite of this general prevalence of marriage by purchase, we have
no evidence that it is a stage through which every race has passed. It
must be observed, first, that in sundry tribes the presents given by
the bridegroom are intended not exactly to compensate the parents for
the bride, but rather to dispose them favourably to the match. Colonel
Dalton says, for example, that, among the Pádams, one of the lowest
peoples of India, it is customary for a lover to show his inclinations
whilst courting by presenting his sweetheart and her parents with small
delicacies, such as field mice and squirrels, though the parents seldom
interfere with the young couple’s designs, and it would be regarded as
an indelible disgrace to barter a child’s happiness for money.[2385]
The Ainos of Yesso, says Mr. Bickmore, “do not buy their wives, but
make presents to the parents of saki, tobacco, and fish;”[2386] and the
amount of these gifts is never settled beforehand.[2387] The game and
fruits given by the bridegroom immediately before marriage, among the
Puris, Coroados, and Coropos, seem to v. Martius to be rather a proof
of his ability to keep a wife than a means of exchange; whereas the
more civilized tribes of the Brazilian aborigines carry on an actual
trade in women.[2388]

Speaking of the Yukonikhotana, a tribe of Alaska, Petroff states
that the custom of purchasing wives does not exist among them.[2389]
The Californian Wintun, who rank among the lower types of the race,
generally pay nothing for their brides.[2390] The Niam-Niam and some
other African peoples,[2391] most of the Chittagong Hill tribes,[2392]
the aboriginal inhabitants of Kola and Kobroor, of the Aru Archipelago,
who live in trees or caves,[2393] and apparently also the Andamanese
are in the habit of marrying without making any payment for the bride.
Among the Veddahs, according to M. Le Mesurier, no marriage presents
are given on either side,[2394] but Mr. Hartshorne states that “a
marriage is attended with no ceremony beyond the presentation of some
food to the parents of the bride.”[2395]

In Ponapé, says Dr. Finsch, marriage is not based on purchase;[2396]
but this is contrary to the general custom in the Carolines,[2397]
as also in the adjacent Pelew Islands,[2398] where women are bought
as wives by means of presents to the father. In the Kingsmill Group,
according to Wilkes, “a wife is never bought, but it is generally
supposed that each party will contribute something towards the
household stock.”[2399] With regard to the Hawaiians, Ellis remarks,
“We are not aware that the parents of the woman received anything from
the husband, or gave any dowry with the wife.”[2400] And Mr. Angas even
asserts that the practice of purchasing wives is not generally adopted
in Polynesia.[2401] But the statement is doubtful, as, at least in
Samoa,[2402] Tahiti,[2403] and Nukahiva,[2404] the bridegroom gains the
bride by presents to her father. And in Melanesia marriage by purchase
is certainly universal.[2405] Among the South Australian Kurnai,
according to Mr. Howitt, marriages were brought about “most frequently
by elopement, less frequently by capture, and least frequently by
exchange or by gift.”[2406]

Purchase of wives may, with even more reason than marriage by capture,
be said to form a general stage in the social history of man. Although
the two practices often occur simultaneously, the former has, as a
rule, succeeded the latter, as barter in general has followed upon
robbery. The more recent character of marriage by purchase appears
clearly from the fact that marriage by capture very frequently occurs
as a symbol where marriage by purchase occurs as a reality. Moreover,
there can be little doubt that barter and commerce are comparatively
late inventions of man.

Dr. Peschel, indeed, contends that barter existed in those ages in
which we find the earliest signs of our race. But we have no evidence
that it was in this way that the cave-dwellers of Périgord, of the
reindeer period, obtained the rock crystals, the Atlantic shells, and
the horns of the Polish Saiga antelope, which have been found in their
settlements; and we may not in any case, conclude that “commerce has
existed in all ages, and among all inhabitants of the world.”[2407]
There are even in modern times instances of savage peoples who seem to
have a very vague idea of barter, or perhaps none at all. Concerning
certain Solomon Islanders, Labillardière states, “We could not learn
whether these people are in the habit of making exchanges; but it is
very certain that it was impossible for us to obtain anything from
them in this way; ... yet they were very eager to receive everything
that we gave them.”[2408] For some time after Captain Weddell began
to associate with the Fuegians, they gave him any small article he
expressed a wish for, without asking any return; but afterwards they
“acquired an idea of barter.”[2409] Nor did the Australians whom Cook
saw, and the Patagonians visited by Captain Wallis in 1766, understand
traffic, though they now understand it.[2410] Again, with regard to the
Andamanese Mr. Man remarks, “They set no fixed value on their various
properties, and rarely make or procure anything with the express
object of disposing of it in barter. Apparently they prefer to regard
their transactions as presentations, for their mode of negotiating
is to _give_ such objects as are desired by another in the hope of
receiving in return something for which they have expressed a wish, it
being tacitly understood that unless otherwise mentioned beforehand,
no ‘present’ is to be accepted without an equivalent being rendered.
The natural consequence of this system is that most of the quarrels
which so frequently occur among them originate in failure on the part
of the recipient in making such a return as had been confidently
expected.”[2411] It must also be noted that those uncivilized peoples
among whom marriage by purchase does not occur are, for the most part,
exceedingly rude races.

As M. Koenigswarter[2412] and Mr. Spencer[2413] have suggested, the
transition from marriage by capture to marriage by purchase was
probably brought about in the following way: abduction, in spite
of parents, was the primary form; then there came the offering of
compensation to escape vengeance; and this grew eventually into the
making of presents beforehand. Thus, among the Ahts, according to Mr.
Sproat, when a man steals a wife, a purchase follows, “as the friends
of the woman must be pacified with presents.”[2414] In New Guinea[2415]
and Bali,[2416] as also among the Chukmas[2417] and Araucanians,[2418]
it often happens that the bridegroom carries off, or elopes with, his
bride, and afterwards pays a compensation-price to her parents. Among
the Bodo and Mech, who still preserve the form of forcible abduction in
their marriage ceremony, the successful lover, after having captured
the girl, gives a feast to the bride’s friends and with a present
conciliates the father, who is supposed to be incensed.[2419] The same
is reported of the Maoris,[2420] whilst among the Tangutans, according
to Prejevalsky, the ravisher who has stolen his neighbour’s wife pays
the husband a good sum as compensation, but keeps the wife.[2421]

It is a matter of no importance in this connection that among certain
peoples, the price of the bride is paid not to the father, but to
some other nearly related person, especially an uncle,[2422] or to
some other relatives as well as to the father.[2423] In any case
the price is to be regarded as a compensation for the loss sustained
in the giving up of the girl, and as a remuneration for the expenses
incurred in her maintenance till the time of her marriage.[2424]
Sometimes, as among several negro peoples, daughters are trained for
the purpose of being disposed of at a profit; but this is a modern
invention, irreconcilable with savage ideas. Thus, among the Kafirs,
the practice of making an express bargain about women hardly prevailed
in the first quarter of this century, and the verb applied to the act
of giving cattle for a girl, according to Mr. Shooter, involves not the
idea of an actual trade, but rather that of reward for her birth and
nurture.[2425]

To most savages there seems nothing objectionable in marriage by
purchase. On the contrary, Mr. Bancroft states that the Indians in
Columbia consider it in the highest degree disgraceful to the girl’s
family, if she is given away without a price;[2426] and, in certain
tribes of California, “the children of a woman for whom no money was
paid are accounted no better than bastards, and the whole family are
contemned.”[2427] It was left for a higher civilization to raise women
from this state of debasement. In the next chapter we shall consider
the process by which marriage ceased to be a purchase contract, and
woman an object of trade.




CHAPTER XVIII

THE DECAY OF MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE. THE MARRIAGE PORTION


It has often been said that the position of women is the surest gauge
of a people’s civilization. This assertion, though not absolutely,
is approximately true. The evolution of altruism is one of the chief
elements in human progress, and consideration for the weaker sex is one
of the chief elements in the evolution of altruism.

According as more elevated ideas regarding women grew up among the
so-called civilized peoples, the practice of purchasing wives was
gradually abandoned, and came to be looked upon as infamous. The
wealthier classes took the first step, and poorer and ruder persons
followed their example. It is of no little interest to follow the
course of this process.

In India, in ancient times, the Âsura form, or marriage by purchase,
was lawful for all the four castes. Afterwards it fell into disrepute,
and was prohibited among the Brahmans and Kshatriyas, but it was
approved of in the case of a Vaiśya and of a Śudra. Manu forbade it
altogether.[2428] “No father who knows the law,” he says, “must take
even the smallest gratuity for his daughter; for a man who, through
avarice, takes a gratuity, is a seller of his offspring.”[2429]
Purchase survived as a symbol only in the Ârsha form, according to
which the bridegroom sent a cow and a bull or two pairs to the
bride’s father.[2430] Manu expressly condemns those who call this
gift a gratuity;[2431] hence the Ârsha form was counted by Manu and
other lawgivers as one of the legitimate modes of marriage.[2432]
The Greeks of the historical age had ceased to buy their wives; and
in Rome, _confarreatio_, which suggested no idea of purchase, was in
the very earliest known time the form of marriage in force among the
patricians. Among clients and plebeians also, the purchase of wives
came to an end in remote antiquity, surviving as a mere symbol in their
_coemptio_.[2433] Among the Germans, according to Grimm, it was only
Christianity that abolished marriage by purchase.[2434] Laferrière
and Koenigswarter think it prevailed among the Saxons as late as the
reign of Charles the Great, and that in England it was prohibited by
Cnut.[2435] In _Lex Alamannorum_, _Lex Ripuariorum_, ‘Grâgâs,’ and
the Norwegian laws, real purchase money is not spoken of; and there is
reason to believe that the “mundr,” mentioned in the elder ‘Gula-lag’
had gradually lost its original meaning of price for a bride.[2436]

In the Talmudic law, the purchase of wives appears as merely symbolic,
the bride-price being fixed at a nominal amount.[2437] The Mohammedan
“mahr” is also frequently merely nominal.[2438] Among the Finns,
the purchase of wives had disappeared in the remote times when their
popular songs originated.[2439] Though it still was usual for a
bridegroom to give presents to his bride and her parents, passages
in the songs indicate that not even the memory of a real purchase
survived.[2440] In China, although marriage presents correspond
exactly to purchase-money in a contract of sale, the people will not
hear of their being called a “price”;[2441] which shows that, among
them also, some feeling of shame is attached to the idea of selling a
daughter.

We may discern two different ways in which this gradual disappearance
of marriage by purchase has taken place. It has been suggested that the
sum with which the bridegroom bought the bride became a payment for
the guardianship of her.[2442] However this may be, the purchase-money
became in time smaller and smaller, and took in many cases the form of
more or less arbitrary presents. Only a relic of the ancient custom, as
we have seen, was left, often appearing as a sham sale in the marriage
ceremonies. Another mode of preserving the symbol of sale was the
receipt of a gift of real value, which was immediately returned to the
giver. This arrangement is said by Âpastamba to have been prescribed
by the Vedas “in order to fulfil the law”—that is, the ancient law
by which the binding form of marriage was a sale.[2443] Generally,
however, not the same but another gift is presented in return. Thus,
at Athens, at some time which cannot be determined, but which was
undoubtedly earlier than the age of Solon, the dower in the modern
sense arose; and, as has been suggested,[2444] this portioning of the
bride by her father or guardian very probably implied originally a
return of the price paid. Again, in China, exchange of presents takes
place between the guardians of the bridegroom and the guardians of the
bride; and this exchange forms the subject of a long section in the
penal code, for, “the marriage articles and betrothal presents once
exchanged, the parties are considered irrevocably engaged.”[2445] In
Japan, the bride gives certain conventional presents to her future
husband and his parents and relatives, and, as to the value of these
presents, she should always be guided by the value of those brought by
the bridegroom.[2446] Among the ancient Germans, according to Tacitus,
the wife in her turn presented the husband with some kind of arms,
and this mutual exchange of gifts formed the principal bond of their
union.[2447] Grimm also suggests that the meaning of the Teutonic dowry
was partly that of a return gift.[2448]

On the other hand, the purchase-sum was transformed into the morning
gift and the dotal portion. A part—afterwards the whole—was given
to the bride either directly by the bridegroom or by her father.
Manu says, “When the relatives do not appropriate for their use the
gratuity given, it is not a sale; in that case the gift is only a token
of respect and of kindness towards the maidens.”[2449] This gift was
called “çulka,” or her fee; but its close connection with a previous
purchase appears from the fact that it passed in a course of devolution
to the woman’s brothers, and one rendering of the text of Gautama
which regulates this succession, even allowed the fee to go to her
brothers during her life.[2450] In modern India, according to Dubois,
men of distinction do not appropriate the money acquired by giving a
daughter in marriage, but lay it out in jewels, which they present to
the lady on the wedding-day.[2451] Among the Greeks of the Homeric age,
the father did not always keep the wedding-presents for his own use,
but bestowed them, wholly or in part, on the daughter as her marriage
portion. At a later period, the bridegroom himself gave the presents
to his wife, when he saw her unveiled for the first time, or after the
νὺξ μυστική.[2452] Among the Teutons the same process of development
took place. Originally, the purchase-sum went to the guardian of the
bride, partly, perhaps, to her whole family; but by-and-by it came
to be considered her own property,[2453] as Tacitus says, “Dotem non
uxor marito sed uxori maritus offert.”[2454] This was the case among
the Scandinavians at the date of the inditing of their laws, and among
the Langobardi from the seventh century.[2455] “La dot,” says M.
Ginoulhiac, “n’est autre chose que le prix de la coemption en usage
dans la loi salique; elle fut donnée à la femme au lieu de l’être à
ses parents, qui ne reçurent plus que le _solidum_ et _denarium_,
ou le prix fictif, et après la mort de l’épouse, une partie de la
dot.”[2456] In _Lex Alamannorum_ and _Lex Ripuariorum_, only a _dos_
which the wife receives directly from her husband is spoken of.[2457]
And it seems probable that the morning gift, which has survived very
long in Europe,[2458] originated in the purchase-sum, or formed a
part of it,[2459] though it has often been considered a _pretium
virginitatis_.[2460] According to ancient Irish law, a part of the
“coibche,” or bridal gift, went to the bride’s father, or, if he was
dead, to the head of her tribe;[2461] but another part was given by the
bridegroom to the bride herself after marriage. The same was the case
with the Welsh “cowyll”;[2462] and the Slavonic word for bride-price,
“vĕno,” came to be frequently used for _dos_.[2463]

Speaking of the ancient Babylonians, Herodotus says that “the
marriage portions were furnished by the money paid for the beautiful
damsels.”[2464] Among the Hebrews, as it seems the “mohar,” or a
part of it, was given to the bride herself.[2465] We read in the
Book of Genesis that Abraham’s servant “brought forth jewels of
silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebecca: he
gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.”[2466]
Professor Robertson Smith is inclined to believe that, in Arabia,
before Mohammed, a custom had established itself by which the husband
ordinarily made a gift—under the name of “sadâc”—to his wife upon
marriage, or by which a part of the “mahr” was customarily set aside
for her use.[2467] But under Islam the difference between “mahr”
and “sadâc” disappeared, the price paid to the father becoming the
property of the woman.[2468]

But it is not only in the history of the great civilized nations that
we find marriage by purchase falling into decay. Among several peoples
who are still in a savage or semi-civilized state, the custom of
purchasing the wife has been modified, and of a few it is expressly
stated that they consider such a traffic disgraceful.[2469] The change
has taken place in exactly the same way as we have seen to be the case
with higher races.

On the one hand, the purchase has become more or less a symbol. In some
cases the gift no longer represents the actual value of the girl, in
others it is followed by a return gift. Thus, in Oregon, “the wife’s
relations always raise as many horses (or other property) for her
dower, as the bridegroom has sent the parents, but scrupulously take
care not to turn over the same horses or the same articles.”[2470] The
Ahts consider it a point of honour that the purchase-money given for
a woman of rank shall, some time or other, be returned in a present
of equal value.[2471] Similar statements are made with reference
to the Patagonians,[2472] Mishmis,[2473] and certain tribes in the
Indian Archipelago.[2474] Among the Bagobos of the Philippines, if the
newly-married couple are satisfied with each other, the father of the
wife gives the half of the purchase-sum back to the husband;[2475]
whilst, in Saraë, the girl’s father, at the wedding, has to return even
five times the price which he received from the bridegroom’s father at
the espousals, the return gift, however, becoming the common property
of the married couple.[2476] Among the Badagas of the Neilgherries
also, the return gift is generally greater in value than the sum which
has been paid for her.[2477] Several other peoples contract marriages
by an exchange of presents.[2478]

On the other hand there are peoples among whom the purchase-sum, or
a part of it, is given to the bride either by her father or by the
bridegroom himself. But, as this may be an indirect way of compensating
the bridegroom for the price he has paid, it is in many cases almost
impossible to distinguish between this custom and the one last
mentioned. It is equally hard to distinguish between the cases in which
the bride receives a part of the price from her father, and those in
which she receives a gift from the bridegroom directly. But perhaps the
greatest difficulty of all is to make out whether the presents obtained
from the bridegroom formed originally a part of the bride-price or were
only a means of gaining her own consent. Among the Eskimo, the lover
presents clothes to the lady, who puts them on, and is thenceforth
his wife.[2479] Among the Dacotahs, men ask for consent to marriage
by sending the price of the girl, and in addition often give presents
to the object of their esteem.[2480] Speaking of the South American
Guanas, Azary says, “Toutes les cérémonies du mariage se réduisent à
un petit présent que le mari fait à sa prétendue.”[2481] Again, among
the Javanese,[2482] Kalmucks,[2483] and Ahl el Shemál, a Bedouin tribe
of Syria,[2484] the money or articles which the father receives for
his daughter are generally looked upon as a settlement or provision
for the wife; and among the Pelew Islanders,[2485] Mishmis,[2486]
Bashkirs,[2487] Votyaks,[2488] &c.,[2489] she receives a larger or
smaller part of the bride-price.

From marriage by purchase we have thus reached the practice of dower,
which is apparently the very reverse of it. But, as we have seen, the
marriage portion derives its origin partly from the purchase of wives.
Where, as among the Marea,[2490] the endowment becomes the exclusive
property of the husband, it is, no doubt, intended to be a compensation
for the bride-price; whilst, among other peoples, money or goods for
which the man has bought his wife are handed over to her by the father
as a marriage portion which, in a certain way, belongs to her. Yet, as
we shall see directly, the dowry does not in every case spring from a
previous purchase.

The marriage portion serves different ends, often indissolubly mixed
up together. It may have the meaning of a return gift. It may imply
that the wife as well as the husband is expected to contribute to the
expenses of the joint household. It is also very often intended to be a
settlement for the wife in case the marriage be dissolved through the
husband’s death or otherwise. But as, in such instances, the husband
generally has th
