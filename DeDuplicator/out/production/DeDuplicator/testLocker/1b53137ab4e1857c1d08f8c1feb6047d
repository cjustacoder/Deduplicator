INTRODUCTORY NOTE

BY ALFRED R. WALLACE


Having read the proofs of Mr. Westermarck’s book I am asked by the
publishers to say a few words by way of introducing the work to
English readers. This I have great pleasure in doing, because I have
seldom read a more thorough or a more philosophic discussion of some
of the most difficult, and at the same time interesting problems of
anthropology.

The origin and development of human marriage have been discussed by
such eminent writers as Darwin, Spencer, Morgan, Lubbock, and many
others. On some of the more important questions involved in it all
these writers are in general accord, and this agreement has led to
their opinions being widely accepted as if they were well-established
conclusions of science. But on several of these points Mr. Westermarck
has arrived at different, and sometimes diametrically opposite,
conclusions, and he has done so after a most complete and painstaking
investigation of all the available facts.

With such an array of authority on the one side and a hitherto unknown
student on the other, it will certainly be thought that all the
probabilities are against the latter. Yet I venture to anticipate that
the verdict of independent thinkers will, on most of these disputed
points, be in favour of the new comer who has so boldly challenged
the conclusions of some of our most esteemed writers. Even those whose
views are here opposed, will, I think, acknowledge that Mr. Westermarck
is a careful investigator and an acute reasoner, and that his arguments
as well as his conclusions are worthy of the most careful consideration.

I would also call attention to his ingenious and philosophical
explanation of the repugnance to marriage between near relatives which
is so very general both among savage and civilised man, and as to the
causes of which there has been great diversity of opinion; and to his
valuable suggestions on the general question of sexual selection, in
which he furnishes an original argument against Darwin’s views on the
point, differing somewhat from my own though in general harmony with it.

Every reader of the work will admire its clearness of style, and the
wonderful command of what is to the author a foreign language.




PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION


I need scarcely say how fully I appreciate the honour of being
introduced to English readers by Mr. Alfred R. Wallace. I am also
greatly obliged for his kindness in reading the proofs, and in giving
me the benefit of his advice with regard to various parts of the
subject.

It is difficult for me to acknowledge sufficiently my obligations
to Mr. James Sime for his assistance in preparing this book for the
press. The work, as originally written, naturally contained a good many
foreign modes of expression. Mr. Sime has been indefatigable in helping
me to improve the form of the text; and, in our discussions on the main
lines of the argument, he has made several important suggestions. I am
sincerely obliged for the invaluable aid he has given me.

My cordial thanks are due to Mr. Charles J. Cooke, British Vice-Consul
at Helsingfors, who most kindly aided me in writing the first part of
the book in a tongue which is not my own. I am indebted also to Dr.
E. B. Tylor, Professor G. Croom Robertson, Mr. James Sully, and Dr. W.
C. Coupland for much encouraging interest; to Mr. Joseph Jacobs for
the readiness with which he has placed at my disposal some results of
his own researches; and to several gentlemen in different parts of the
world who have been so good as to respond to my inquiries as to their
personal observation of various classes of phenomena connected with
marriage among savage tribes. The information I have received from them
is acknowledged in the passages in which it is used.

A list of authorities is given at the end of the book—between the text
and the index, and it may be well to add that the references in the
notes have been carefully verified.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION


In this new edition of my book I have made no essential changes, but
here and there the argument has been strengthened by the addition of
facts which have come to my knowledge since the appearance of the first
edition. The most important of these new facts will be found in the
second chapter.

I take this opportunity of expressing my warm appreciation of the
thorough way in which the ideas set forth in this book have been
discussed by many critics in England and elsewhere. Translations of the
work have appeared, or are about to appear, in German, Swedish, French,
Italian, and Russian.

 LONDON, _January, 1894_.




PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION


I much regret that the demand for a new edition of this book should
come at a time when circumstances prevent me from undertaking such a
revision of the work as I feel to be required. Since the appearance
of the Second Edition many important facts bearing upon the subject
have been brought to light, new theories have been advanced, and old
theories, supported by fresh arguments, have been revived. To all this,
however, I can do no justice, as I am at present being engaged in
anthropological research in Morocco. This edition is, in consequence, a
mere reprint of the second. But I purpose, after my return to Europe,
to issue an Appendix, in which the book will be brought more up to date
and some criticism will be replied to.

 system with uncertainty as to fathers, _ibid._—Avowed recognition of
 kinship in the female line only does not show an unconsciousness of

                       HISTORY OF HUMAN MARRIAGE




INTRODUCTION

ON THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION


It is in the firm conviction that the history of human civilization
should be made an object of as scientific a treatment as the history of
organic nature that I write this book. Like the phenomena of physical
and psychical life those of social life should be classified into
certain groups, and each group investigated with regard to its origin
and development. Only when treated in this way can history lay claim to
the rank and honour of a science in the highest sense of the term, as
forming an important part of Sociology the youngest of the principal
branches of learning.

Descriptive historiography has no higher object than that of offering
materials to this science. It can, however, but very inadequately
fulfil this task. The written evidences of history do not reach far
into antiquity. They give us information about times when the scale
of civilization was already comparatively high—but scarcely anything
more. As to the origin and early development of social institutions,
they leave us entirely in the dark. The sociologist cannot rest content
with this. But the information which historical documents are unable to
afford him, may be, to a great extent, obtained from ethnography.

The admirable works of Dr. Tylor, Sir John Lubbock, and Mr. Herbert
Spencer have already made us familiar with the idea of a history of
primitive civilization, based on ethnographical grounds. This new
manner of treating history has, since the publication of their writings
on the subject, gained adherents day by day. Immeasurable expanses have
thus been opened to our knowledge, and many important results have
been reached. But it must, on the other hand, be admitted that the
scientific value of the conclusions drawn from ethnographical facts has
not always been adequate to the labour, thought, and acumen bestowed
on them. The various investigators have, in many important questions,
come to results so widely different, that the possibility of thus
getting any information about the past might easily be doubted. These
differences, however, seem to me to be due, not to the material, but to
the manner of treating it.

“The chief sources of information regarding the early history of civil
society,” says Mr. McLennan, “are, first, the study of races in their
primitive condition; and, second, the study of the symbols employed by
advanced nations in the constitution or exercise of civil rights.”[1]

Yet nothing has been more fatal to the Science of Society than the
habit of inferring, without sufficient reasons, from the prevalence of
a custom or institution among some savage peoples, that this custom,
this institution is a relic of a stage of development that the whole
human race once went through. Thus the assumption that primitive
men lived in tribes or hordes, all the men of which had promiscuous
intercourse with all the women, where no individual marriage existed,
and the children were the common property of the tribe, is founded,
in the first place, on the statements of some travellers and ancient
writers as to peoples among whom this custom is said actually to
prevail, or to have prevailed. Dr. Post has gone still further in his
book, ‘Die Geschlechtsgenossenschaft der Urzeit und die Entstehung
der Ehe.’ Without adducing any satisfactory reason for his opinion, he
considers it probable that “monogamous marriage originally emerged
everywhere from pure communism in women, through the intermediate
stages of limited communism in women, polyandry, and polygyny.”[2] Mr.
Lewis H. Morgan, in his ‘Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the
Human Family,’ has suggested no fewer than fifteen normal stages in
the evolution of marriage and the family, assuming the existence and
general prevalence of a series of customs and institutions “which
must of necessity have preceded a knowledge of marriage between single
pairs, and of the family itself, in the modern sense of the term.”[3]
According to him, one of the first stages in this series is the
intermarriage of brothers and sisters, as evidence of which he adduces,
besides other facts, the historical statements that one of the Herods
was married to his sister, and Cleopatra was married to her brother.[4]

Again, in the study of symbols, or survivals, the sociologists have by
no means always been so careful as the matter requires. True enough
that “wherever we discover symbolical forms, we are justified in
inferring that in the past life of the people employing them, there
were corresponding realities.”[5] But all depends upon our rightly
interpreting these symbols, and not putting into them a foreign
meaning. The worst is, however, that many customs have been looked upon
as survivals that probably are not so. Thus, for instance, I think that
Mr. McLennan is mistaken in considering the system of the Levirate,
under which, at a man’s death, his wife or wives pass to his brother,
as a test of the former presence of polyandry, the brothers of a family
having a common wife.

Similar conclusions being of common occurrence in modern Sociology, it
is not surprising that different writers dissent so frequently from
each other. This should be a strong reason for every conscientious
investigator first of all putting to himself the question: how can
we from ethnographical facts acquire information regarding the early
history of mankind?

I do not think that this question can be correctly answered in more
than one way. We have first to find out the causes of the social
phenomena; then, from the prevalence of the causes, we may infer the
prevalence of the phenomena themselves, if the former must be assumed
to have operated without being checked by other causes.

If, then, historical researches based on ethnography are to be
crowned with success, the first condition is that there shall be a
rich material. It is only by comparing a large number of facts that
we may hope to find the cause or causes on which a social phenomenon
is dependent. And a rich material is all the more indispensable, as
the trustworthiness of ethnographical statements is not always beyond
dispute. Without a thorough knowledge of a people it is impossible
to give an exact account of its habits and customs, and therefore
it often happens that the statements of a traveller cannot, as
regards trustworthiness, come up to the evidences of history. As the
sociologist is in many cases unable to distinguish falsehood from
truth, he must be prepared to admit the inaccuracy of some of the
statements he quotes. What is wanting in quality must be made up for
in quantity; and he who does not give himself the trouble to read
through a voluminous literature of ethnography should never enter into
speculations on the origin and early development of human civilization.

Often, no doubt, it is extremely difficult to make out the causes
of social phenomena. There are, for instance, among savage peoples
many customs which it seems almost impossible to explain. Still, the
statistical ‘method of investigating the development of institutions,’
admirably set forth in the paper which Dr. Tylor recently read before
‘The Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland,’[6] will
throw light upon many mysterious points. Dr. Tylor has there shown
that causal relations among social facts may be discovered by way of
tabulation and classification. The particular rules of the different
peoples are to be scheduled out into tables, so as to indicate the
“adhesions,” or relations of coexistence of each custom, showing
which peoples have the same custom, and what other customs accompany
it or lie apart from it. If, then, starting with any two customs,
the number of their “adhesions” is found to be much greater than the
number of times they would coexist according to the ordinary law of
chance-distribution—which number is calculated from the total number
of peoples classified and the number of occurrences of each custom—we
may infer that there is some causal connection between the two customs.
Further on, I shall mention some few of the inferences Dr. Tylor has
already drawn by means of this method.

The causes on which social phenomena are dependent fall within the
domain of different sciences—Biology, Psychology, or Sociology. The
reader will find that I put particular stress upon the psychological
causes, which have often been deplorably overlooked, or only
imperfectly touched upon. And more especially do I believe that the
mere instincts have played a very important part in the origin of
social institutions and rules.

We could not, however, by following the method of investigation here
set forth, form any idea of the earlier stages of human development,
unless we had _some_ previous knowledge of the antiquity of mankind.
Otherwise we should, of course, be quite ignorant whether the causes
in question operated or not in the past. Fortunately, in this respect
also, modern science has come to results which scarcely admit any
longer of being considered as mere hypotheses. It teaches us, to
quote Sir John Lubbock, “that man was at first a mere savage, and
that the course of history has on the whole been a progress towards
civilization, though at times—and at some times for centuries—some
races have been stationary, or even have retrograded;”[7] that,
however, all savage nations now existing are raised high above
primitive men; and that the first beings worthy to be called men,
were probably the gradually transformed descendants of some ape-like
ancestor. We may, further, take for granted that all the physical and
psychical qualities that man, in his present state, has in common with
his nearest relatives among the lower animals, also occurred at the
earlier stages of human civilization. These conclusions open to us a
rich source of new knowledge.

Finally, as to social survivals, I agree, certainly, with Mr. McLennan
that they are of great importance to Sociology. But we must be
extremely careful not to regard as rudiments customs which may be more
satisfactorily explained otherwise.

It is only by strictly keeping to these principles that we may hope
to derive information touching the early history of man. In doing so,
the student will be on his guard against rash conclusions. Considering
that he has to make out the primary sources of social phenomena before
writing their history, he will avoid assuming a custom to be primitive,
only because, at the first glance, it appears so; he will avoid making
rules of exceptions, and constructing the history of human development
on the immediate ground of isolated facts. It is true that the critical
sociologist, on account of the deficiency of our knowledge, very often
has to be content with hypotheses and doubtful presumptions. At any
rate, the interests of science are better looked to, if we readily
acknowledge our ignorance, than if we pass off vague guesses as
established truths.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is one of the simplest of all social institutions the history of
which forms the subject of this book. Indeed, next to the family
consisting of mother and offspring only, marriage is probably _the_
simplest. I shall not, however, treat this subject in all its aspects,
but confine myself to human marriage, though before dealing with it I
must, of course, touch upon the sexual relations of the lower animals
also.

The expression “human marriage” will probably be regarded by most
people as an improper tautology. But, as we shall see, marriage, in
the natural history sense of the term, does not belong exclusively
to our own species. No more fundamental difference between man and
other animals should be implied in sociological than in biological and
psychological terminology. Arbitrary classifications do science much
injury.

I shall examine human marriage from its different sides, giving, in
accordance with my method, an historical account of each separately.
The reader may find much that will outrage his feelings, and, possibly,
hurt his sense of modesty; but the concealment of truth is the only
indecorum known to science. To keep anything secret within its cold and
passionless expanses, would be the same as to throw a cloth round a
naked statue.




CHAPTER I

THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE


From remote antiquity we are told of kings and rulers who instituted
marriage amongst their subjects. We read in ‘Mahâbhârata,’ the Indian
poem, that formerly “women were unconfined, and roved about at their
pleasure, independent. Though in their youthful innocence, they went
astray from their husbands, they were guilty of no offence; for such
was the rule in early times.” But Swêtakêtu, son of the Rishi Uddâlaka,
could not bear this custom, and established the rule that thenceforward
wives should remain faithful to their husbands and husbands to their
wives.[8] The Chinese annals recount that, “in the beginning, men
differed in nothing from other animals in their way of life. As
they wandered up and down in the woods, and women were in common,
it happened that children never knew their fathers, but only their
mothers.” The Emperor Fou-hi abolished, however, this indiscriminate
intercourse of the sexes and instituted marriage.[9] Again, the ancient
Egyptians are stated to be indebted to Menes for this institution,[10]
and the Greeks to Kekrops. Originally, it is said, they had no idea
of conjugal union; they gratified their desires promiscuously, and
the children that sprang from these irregular connections always bore
the mother’s name. But Kekrops showed the Athenians the inconvenience
to society from such an abuse, and established the laws and rules
of marriage.[11] The remote Laplanders, also, sing about Njavvis and
Attjis, who instituted marriage, and bound their wives by sacred
oaths.[12]

Popular imagination prefers the clear and concrete; it does not
recognize any abstract laws that rule the universe. Nothing exists
without a cause, but this cause is not sought in an agglomeration of
external or internal forces; it is taken to be simple and palpable,
a personal being, a god or a king. Is it not natural, then, that
marriage, which plays such an important part in the life of the
individual, as well as in that of the people, should be ascribed to a
wise and powerful ruler, or to direct divine intervention?

With notions of this kind science has nothing to do. If we want to
find out the origin of marriage, we have to strike into another path,
the only one which can lead to the truth, but a path which is open
to him alone who regards organic nature as one continued chain, the
last and most perfect link of which is man. For we can no more stop
within the limits of our own species, when trying to find the root of
our psychical and social life, than we can understand the physical
condition of the human race without taking into consideration that of
the lower animals. I must, therefore, beg the reader to follow me into
a domain which many may consider out of the way, but which we must, of
necessity, explore in order to discover what we seek.

It is obvious that the preservation of the progeny of the lowest
animals depends mainly upon chance. In the great sub-kingdom of the
Invertebrata, even the mothers are exempted from nearly all anxiety as
regards their offspring. In the highest order, the Insects, the eggs
are hatched by the heat of the sun, and the mother, in most cases,
does not even see her young. Her care is generally limited to seeking
out an appropriate place for laying the eggs, and to fastening them to
some proper object and covering them, if this be necessary for their
preservation. Again, to the male’s share nothing falls but the function
of propagation.[13]

In the lowest classes of the Vertebrata, parental care is likewise
almost unheard of. In the immense majority of species, young fishes are
hatched without the assistance of their parents, and have, from the
outset, to help themselves. Many Teleostei form, however, an exception;
and, curiously enough, it is the male on which, in these cases, the
parental duty generally devolves. In some instances he constructs a
nest, and jealously guards the ova deposited in it by the female; while
the male of certain species of Arius carries the ova about with him in
his capacious pharynx.[14] Most of the Reptiles place their eggs in a
convenient and sunny spot between moss and leaves, and take no further
trouble about them. But several of the larger serpents have a curious
fashion of laying them in a heap, and then coiling themselves around
them in a great hollow cone.[15] And female Crocodiles, as also certain
aquatic snakes of Cochin China, observed by Dr. Morice, carry with them
even their young.[16]

Among the lower Vertebrata it rarely happens that both parents jointly
take care of their progeny. M. Milne Edwards states, indeed, that in
the Pipa, or Toad of Surinam, the male helps the female to disburthen
herself of her eggs;[17] and the Chelonia are known to live in pairs.
“La femelle,” says M. Espinas, “vient sur les plages sablonneuses au
moment de la ponte, accompagnée du mâle, et construit un nid en forme
de four où la chaleur du soleil fait éclore les œufs.”[18] But it may
be regarded as an almost universal rule that the relations of the sexes
are utterly fickle. The male and female come together in the paring
time; but having satisfied their sexual instincts they part again, and
have nothing more to do with one another.

The Chelonia form, with regard to their domestic habits, a transition
to the Birds, as they do also from a zoological and, particularly,
from an embryological point of view. In the latter class, parental
affection has reached a very high degree of development, not only on
the mother’s side, but also on the father’s. Male and female help each
other to build the nest, the former generally bringing the materials,
the latter doing the work. In fulfilling the numberless duties of the
breeding season, both birds take a share. Incubation rests principally
with the mother, but the father, as a rule, helps his companion, taking
her place when she wants to leave the nest for a moment, or providing
her with food and protecting her from every danger. Finally, when the
duties of the breeding season are over, and the result desired is
obtained, a period with new duties commences. During the first few
days after hatching, most birds rarely leave their young for long, and
then only to procure food for themselves and their family. In cases
of great danger, both parents bravely defend their offspring. As soon
as the first period of helplessness is over, and the young have grown
somewhat, they are carefully taught to shift for themselves; and it is
only when they are perfectly capable of so doing that they leave the
nest and the parents.

There are, indeed, a few birds that from the first day of their
ultra-oval existence lack all parental care; and in some species, as
the ducks, it frequently happens that the male leaves family duties
wholly to the female. But, as a general rule, both share prosperity and
adversity. The hatching of the eggs and the chief part of the rearing
duties belong to the mother,[19] whilst the father acts as protector,
and provides food, &c.

The relations of the sexes are thus of a very intimate character,
male and female keeping together not only during the breeding season,
but also after it. Nay, most birds, with the exception of those
belonging to the Gallinaceous family, when pairing, do so once for all
till either one or the other dies. And Dr. Brehm is so filled with
admiration for their exemplary family life, that he enthusiastically
declares that “real genuine marriage can only be found among
birds.”[20]

This certainly cannot be said of most of the Mammals. The mother
is, indeed, very ardently concerned for the welfare of her young,
generally nursing them with the utmost affection, but this is by no
means the case with the father. There are cases in which he acts as
an enemy of his own progeny. But there are not wanting instances to
the contrary, the connections between the sexes, though generally
restricted to the time of the rut, being, with several species of a
more durable character. This is the case with whales,[21] seals,[22]
the hippopotamus,[23] the _Cervus campestris_,[24] gazelles,[25] the
_Neotragus Hemprichii_ and other small antelopes,[26] reindeer,[27] the
_Hydromus coypus_,[28] squirrels,[29] moles,[30] the ichneumon,[31] and
some carnivorous animals, as a few cats and martens,[32] the yaguarundi
in South America,[33] the _Canis Brasiliensis_,[34] and possibly also
the wolf.[35] Among all these animals the sexes remain together even
after the birth of the young, the male being the protector of the
family.

What among lower Mammals is an exception, is among the Quadrumana a
rule. The natives of Madagascar relate that in some species of the
Prosimii, male and female nurse their young in common[36]—a statement,
however, which has not yet been proved to be true. The mirikina
(_Nyctipithecus trivirgatus_) seems, according to Rengger, to live in
pairs throughout the whole year, for, whatever the season, a male and a
female are always found together.[37] Of the _Mycetes Caraya_, _Cebus
Azarae_,[38] and _Ateles paniscus_,[39] single individuals are very
seldom, or never, seen, whole families being generally met with. Among
the Arctopitheci,[40] the male parent is expressly said to assist the
female in taking care of the young ones.

The most interesting to us are, of course, the man-like apes. Diard
was told by the Malays, and he found it afterwards to be true, that
the young Siamangs, when in their helpless state, are carried about by
their parents, the males by the father, the females by the mother.[41]
Lieutenant C. de Crespigny, who was wandering in the northern part of
Borneo in 1870, gives the following description of the Orang-utan:
“They live in families—the male, female, and a young one. On one
occasion I found a family in which were two young ones, one of them
much larger than the other, and I took this as a proof that the family
tie had existed for at least two seasons. They build commodious
nests in the trees which form their feeding-ground, and, so far as I
could observe, the nests, which are well lined with dry leaves, are
only occupied by the female and young, the male passing the night in
the fork of the same or another tree in the vicinity. The nests are
very numerous all over the forests, for they are not occupied above
a few nights, the mias (or Orang-utan) leading a roving life.”[42]
According to Dr. Mohnike, however, the old males generally live with
the females during the rutting season only;[43] and Mr. Wallace never
saw two full-grown animals together. But as he sometimes found not only
females, but also males, accompanied by half-grown young ones,[44]
we may take for granted that the offspring of the Orang-utan are not
devoid of all paternal care.

More unanimous are the statements which we have regarding the Gorilla.
According to Dr. Savage, they live in bands, and all his informants
agree in the assertion that but one adult male is seen in every band.
“It is said that when the male is first seen he gives a terrific yell
that resounds far and wide through the forest.... The females and young
at the first cry quickly disappear; he then approaches the enemy in
great fury, pouring out his horrid cries in quick succession.”[45]
Again, Mr. Du Chaillu found “almost always one male with one female,
though sometimes the old male wanders companionless;”[46] and Mr.
Winwood Reade states likewise that the Gorilla goes “sometimes alone,
sometimes accompanied by his female and young one.”[47] The same
traveller was told that, when a family of Gorillas ascend a tree and
eat a certain fruit, the old father remains seated at the foot of the
tree. And when the female is pregnant, he builds a rude nest, usually
about fifteen or twenty feet from the ground; here she is delivered,
and the nest is then abandoned.[48]

For more recent information about the Gorilla we are indebted to Herr
von Koppenfells. He states that the male spends the night crouching
at the foot of the tree, against which he places his back, and thus
protects the female and their young, which are in the nest above, from
the nocturnal attacks of leopards. Once he observed a male and female
with two young ones of different ages, the elder being perhaps about
six years old, the younger about one.[49]

When all these statements are compared, it is impossible to doubt that
the Gorilla lives in families, the male parent being in the habit of
building the nest and protecting the family. And the same is the case
with the Chimpanzee. According to Dr. Savage, “it is not unusual to
see ‘the old folks’ sitting under a tree regaling themselves with
fruit and friendly chat, while ‘their children’ are leaping around
them and swinging from branch to branch in boisterous merriment.”[50]
And Herr von Koppenfells assures us that the Chimpanzee, like the
Gorilla, builds a nest for the young and female on a forked branch, the
male himself spending the night lower down in the tree.[51]

Passing from the highest monkeys to the savage and barbarous races
of man, we meet with the same phenomenon. With the exception of a
few cases in which certain tribes are asserted to live together
promiscuously—almost all of which assertions I shall prove further on
to be groundless—travellers unanimously agree that in the human race
the relations of the sexes are, as a rule, of a more or less durable
character. The family consisting of father, mother, and offspring, is
a universal institution, whether founded on a monogamous, polygynous,
or polyandrous marriage. And, as among the lower animals having the
same habit, it is to the mother that the immediate care of the children
chiefly belongs, while the father is the protector and guardian of the
family. Man in the savage state is generally supposed to be rather
indifferent to the welfare of his wife and children, and this is really
often the case, especially if he be compared with civilized man. But
the simplest paternal duties are, nevertheless, universally recognized.
If he does nothing else, the father builds the habitation, and employs
himself in the chase and in war.

Thus, among the North American Indians, it was considered disgraceful
for a man to have more wives than he was able to maintain.[52] Mr.
Powers says that among the Patwin, a Californian tribe which ranks
among the lowest in the world, “the sentiment that the men are bound
to support the women—that is to furnish the supplies—is stronger even
than among us.”[53] Among the Iroquois it was the office of the husband
“to make a mat, to repair the cabin of his wife, or to construct a new
one.” The product of his hunting expeditions, during the first year of
marriage, belonged of right to his wife, and afterwards he shared it
equally with her, whether she remained in the village, or accompanied
him to the chase.[54] Azara states that among the Charruas of South
America, “du moment où un homme se marie, il forme une famille à part
et travaille pour la nourrir;”[55] and among the Fuegians, according
to Admiral Fitzroy, “as soon as a youth is able to maintain a wife,
by his exertions in fishing or bird-catching, he obtains the consent
of her relations.”[56] Again, among the utterly rude Botocudos, whose
girls are married very young, remaining in the house of the father till
the age of puberty, the husband is even then obliged to maintain his
wife, though living apart from her.[57]

To judge from the recent account of Herr Lumholtz, the paternal duties
seemed to be scarcely recognized by the natives of Queensland.[58] But
with reference to the Kurnai in South Australia, Mr. Howitt states
that “the man has to provide for his family with the assistance of
his wife. His share is to hunt for their support, and to fight for
their protection.” As a Kurnai once said to him, “A man hunts, spears
fish, fights, and sits about.”[59] And in the Encounter Bay tribe the
paternal care is considered so indispensable, that, if the father dies
before a child is born, the child is put to death by the mother, as
there is no longer any one to provide for it.[60]

Among the cannibals of New Britain, the chiefs have to see that the
families of the warriors are properly maintained.[61] As regards the
Tonga Islanders, Martin remarks, “A married woman is one who cohabits
with a man, and lives under his roof and protection;”[62] and in
Samoa, according to Mr. Pritchard, “whatever intercourse may take
place between the sexes, a woman does not become a man’s wife unless
the latter take her to his own house.”[63] Among the Maoris, says Mr.
Johnston, “the mission of woman was to increase and multiply; that
of man to defend his home.”[64] In Radack, even natural children are
received by the father into his house, as soon as they are able to
walk.[65]

The Rev. D. Macdonald states that, in some African tribes, “a father
has to fast after the birth of his child, or take some such method of
showing that he recognizes that he as well as the mother should take
care of the young stranger.”[66] Certain Africans will not even go on
any warlike expedition when they have a young child;[67] and the South
American Guaranies, while their wives are pregnant do not risk their
lives in hunting wild beasts.[68] In Lado the bridegroom has to assure
his father-in-law three times that he will protect his wife, calling
the people present to witness.[69] And among the Touaregs, according
to Dr. Chavanne, a man who deserts his wife is blamed, as he has taken
upon himself the obligation of maintaining her.[70]

The wretched Rock Veddahs in Ceylon, according to Sir J. Emerson
Tennent, “acknowledge the marital obligation and the duty of
supporting their own families.”[71] Among the Maldivians, “although
a man is allowed four wives at one time, it is only on condition of
his being able to support them.”[72] The Nagas are not permitted to
marry until they are able to set up house on their own account.[73] The
Nairs, we are told, consider it a husband’s duty to provide his wife
with food, clothing, and ornaments;[74] and almost the same is said
by Dr. Schwaner with reference to the tribes of the Barito district,
in the south-east part of Borneo.[75] A Burmese woman can demand a
divorce, if her husband is not able to maintain her properly.[76]
Among the Mohammedans, the maintenance of the children devolves so
exclusively on the father, that the mother is even entitled to claim
wages for nursing them.[77] And among the Romans, _manus_ implied not
only the wife’s subordination to the husband, but also the husband’s
obligation to protect the wife.[78]

The father’s place in the family being that of a supporter and
protector, a man is often not permitted to marry until he has given
some proof of his ability to fulfil these duties.

The Koyúkuns believe that a youth who marries before he has killed
a deer will have no children.[79] The aborigines of Pennsylvania
considered it a shame for a boy to think of a wife before having given
some proof of his manhood.[80] Among the wild Indians of British
Guiana, says Mr. Im Thurn, before a man is allowed to choose a wife he
must prove that he can do a man’s work and is able to support himself
and his family.[81] Among the Dyaks of Borneo,[82] the Nagas of Upper
Assam,[83] and the Alfura of Ceram,[84] no one can marry unless he has
in his possession a certain number of heads. The Karmanians, according
to Strabo, were considered marriageable only after having killed an
enemy.[85] The desire of a Galla warrior is to deprive the enemy of his
genitals, the possession of such a trophy being a necessary preliminary
to marriage.[86] Among the Bechuana and Kafir tribes south of the
Zambesi, the youth is not allowed to take a wife until he has killed
a rhinoceros.[87] In the Marianne Group, the suitor had to give proof
of his bodily strength and skill.[88] And among the Arabs of Upper
Egypt, the man must undergo an ordeal of whipping by the relations of
his bride in order to test his courage. If he wishes to be considered
worth having, he must receive the chastisement, which is sometimes
exceedingly severe, with an expression of enjoyment.[89]

The idea that a man is bound to maintain his family is, indeed, so
closely connected with that of marriage and fatherhood, that sometimes
even repudiated wives with their children are, at least to a certain
extent, supported by their former husbands. This is the case among the
Chukchi of North-Western Asia,[90] the Basutos in Southern Africa,[91]
and the Munda Kols in Chota Nagpore.[92] Further, a wife frequently
enjoys her husband’s protection even after sexual relations have been
broken off. And upon his death, the obligation of maintaining her and
her children devolves on his heirs, the wide-spread custom of a man
marrying the widow of his deceased brother being, as we shall see
in a subsequent chapter, not only a privilege belonging to the man,
but, among several peoples, even a duty. We may thus take for granted
that in the human race, at least at its present stage, the father has
to perform the same function as in other animal species, where the
connections between the sexes last longer than the sexual desire.

       *       *       *       *       *

In encyclopedical and philosophical works we meet with several
different definitions of the word marriage. Most of these definitions
are, however, of a merely juridical or ethical nature, comprehending
either what is required to make the union legal,[93] or what, in the
eye of an idealist, the union ought to be.[94] But it is scarcely
necessary to say how far I am here from using the word in either of
these senses. It is the natural history of human marriage that is the
object of this treatise; and, from a scientific point of view, I think
there is but one definition which may claim to be generally admitted,
that, namely, according to which marriage is nothing else than a more
or less durable connection between male and female, lasting beyond
the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring.
This definition is wide enough to include all others hitherto given,
and narrow enough to exclude those wholly loose connections which by
usage are never honoured with the name of marriage. It implies not
only sexual relations, but also living together, as is set forth in
the proverb of the Middle Ages, “Boire, manger, coucher ensemble est
mariage, ce me semble.”[95] And, though, rather vague, which is a
matter of course, it has the advantage of comprehending in one notion
phenomena essentially similar and having a common origin.

Thus, as appears from the preceding investigation, the first traces of
marriage are found among the Chelonia. With the Birds it is an almost
universal institution, whilst, among the Mammals, it is restricted to
certain species only. We observed, however, that it occurs, as a rule,
among the monkeys, especially the anthropomorphous apes as well as in
the races of men. Is it probable, then, that marriage was transmitted
to man from some ape-like ancestor, and that there never was a time
when it did not occur in the human race? These questions cannot be
answered before we have found out the cause to which it owes its origin.

It is obvious that where the generative power is restricted to a
certain season, it cannot be the sexual instinct that keeps male and
female together for months or years. Nor is there any other egoistic
motive that could probably account for this habit. Considering that
the union lasts till after the birth of the offspring, and considering
the care taken of this by the father, we may assume that the prolonged
union of the sexes is, in some way or other connected with parental
duties. I am, indeed, strongly of opinion that the tie which joins male
and female is an instinct developed through the powerful influence of
natural selection. It is evident that, when the father helps to protect
the offspring, the species is better able to subsist in the struggle
for existence than it would be if this obligation entirely devolved
on the mother. Paternal affection and the instinct which causes male
and female to form somewhat durable alliances, are thus useful mental
dispositions which, in all probability, have been acquired through the
survival of the fittest.

But how, then, can it be that among most animals the father never
concerns himself about his progeny? The answer is not difficult to
find. Marriage is only one of many means by which a species is enabled
to subsist. Where parental care is lacking, we may be sure to find
compensation for it in some other way. Among the Invertebrata, Fishes,
and Reptiles, both parents are generally quite indifferent as to their
progeny. An immense proportion of the progeny therefore succumb before
reaching maturity; but the number of eggs laid is proportionate to the
number of those lost, and the species is preserved nevertheless. If
every grain of roe, spawned by the female fishes, were fecundated and
hatched, the sea would not be large enough to hold all the creatures
resulting from them. The eggs of Reptiles need no maternal care, the
embryo being developed by the heat of the sun; and their young are
from the outset able to help themselves, leading the same life as the
adults. Among Birds, on the other hand, parental care is an absolute
necessity. Equal and continual warmth is the first requirement for
the development of the embryo and the preservation of the young ones.
For this the mother almost always wants the assistance of the father,
who provides her with necessaries, and sometimes relieves her of the
brooding. Among Mammals, the young can never do without the mother
at the tenderest age, but the father’s aid is generally by no means
indispensable. In some species, as the walrus,[96] the elephant,[97]
the _Bos americanus_,[98] and the bat,[99] there seems to be a rather
curious substitute for paternal protection, the females, together with
their young ones, collecting in large herds or flocks apart from the
males. Again, as to the marriage of the Primates, it is, I think, very
probably due to the small number of young, the female bringing forth
but one at a time; and, among the highest apes, as in man, also to the
long period of infancy.[100] Perhaps, too, the defective family life
of the Orang-utan, compared with that of the Gorilla and Chimpanzee,
depends upon the fewer dangers to which this animal is exposed. For
“except man,” Dr. Mohnike says, “the Orang-utan in Borneo has
no enemy of equal strength.”[101] In short, the factors which the
existence of a species depends upon, as the number of the progeny,
their ability to help themselves when young, maternal care, marriage,
&c., vary indefinitely in different species. But in those that do not
succumb, all these factors are more or less proportionate to each
other, the product always being the maintenance of the species.

Marriage and family are thus intimately connected with each other: it
is for the benefit of the young that male and female continue to live
together. Marriage is therefore rooted in family, rather than family
in marriage. There are also many peoples among whom true conjugal life
does not begin before a child is born, and others who consider that the
birth of a child out of wedlock makes it obligatory for the parents
to marry. Among the Eastern Greenlanders[102] and the Fuegians,[103]
marriage is not regarded as complete till the woman has become a
mother. Among the Shawanese[104] and Abipones,[105] the wife very often
remains at her father’s house till she has a child. Among the Khyens,
the Ainos of Yesso, and one of the aboriginal tribes of China, the
husband goes to live with his wife at her father’s house, and never
takes her away till after the birth of a child.[106] In Circassia,
the bride and bridegroom are kept apart until the first child is
born;[107] and among the Bedouins of Mount Sinai, a wife never enters
her husband’s tent until she becomes far advanced in pregnancy.[108]
Among the Baele, the wife remains with her parents until she becomes
a mother, and if this does not happen, she stays there for ever, the
husband getting back what he has paid for her.[109] In Siam, a wife
does not receive her marriage portion before having given birth to a
child;[110] while among the Atkha Aleuts, according to Erman, a husband
does not pay the purchase sum before he has become a father.[111]
Again, the Badagas in Southern India have two marriage ceremonies, the
second of which does not take place till there is some indication that
the pair are to have a family; and if there is no appearance of this,
the couple not uncommonly separate.[112] Dr. Bérenger-Féraud states
that, among the Wolofs in Senegambia, “ce n’est que lorsque les signes
de la grossesse sont irrécusables chez la fiancée, quelquefois même ce
n’est qu’après la naissance d’un ou plusieurs enfants, que la cérémonie
du mariage proprement dit s’accomplit.”[113] And the Igorrotes of Luzon
consider no engagement binding until the woman has become pregnant.[114]

On the other hand, Emin Pasha tells us that, among the Mádi in Central
Africa, “should a girl become pregnant, the youth who has been her
companion is bound to marry her, and to pay to her father the customary
price of a bride.”[115] Burton reports a similar custom as prevailing
among peoples dwelling to the south of the equator.[116] Among many of
the wild tribes of Borneo, there is almost unrestrained intercourse
between the youth of both sexes; but, if pregnancy ensue, marriage
is regarded as necessary.[117] The same, as I am informed by Dr.
A. Bunker, is the case with some Karen tribes in Burma. In Tahiti,
according to Cook, the father might kill his natural child, but if he
suffered it to live, the parties were considered to be in the married
state.[118] Among the Tipperahs of the Chittagong Hills,[119] as well
as the peasants of the Ukraine,[120] a seducer is bound to marry the
girl, should she become pregnant. Again, Mr.Powers informs us that,
among the Californian Wintun, if a wife is abandoned when she has a
young child, she is justified by her friends in destroying it on the
ground that it has no supporter.[121] And among the Creeks, a young
woman that becomes pregnant by a man whom she had expected to marry,
and is disappointed, is allowed the same privilege.[122]

It might, however, be supposed that, in man, the prolonged union of the
sexes is due to another cause besides the offspring’s want of parental
care, _i.e._, to the fact that the sexual instinct is not restricted to
any particular season, but endures throughout the whole year. “That
which distinguishes man from the beast,” Beaumarchais says, “is
drinking without being thirsty, and making love at all seasons.” But in
the next chapter, I shall endeavour to show that this is probably not
quite correct, so far as our earliest human or semi-human ancestors are
concerned.




CHAPTER II

A HUMAN PAIRING SEASON IN PRIMITIVE TIMES


Professor Leuckart assumes that the periodicity in the sexual life of
animals depends upon economical conditions, the reproductive matter
being a surplus of the individual economy. Hence he says that the rut
occurs at the time when the proportion between receipts and expenditure
is most favourable.[123]

Though this hypothesis is accepted by several eminent physiologists,
facts do not support the assumption that the power of reproduction is
correlated with abundance of food and bodily vigour. There are some
writers who even believe that the reverse is the case.[124]

At any rate, it is not correct to say, with Dr. Gruenhagen, that “the
general wedding-feast is spring, when awakening nature opens, to most
animals, new and ample sources of living.”[125] This is certainly true
of Reptiles and Birds, but not of Mammals; every month or season of the
year is the pairing season of one or another mammalian species.[126]
But notwithstanding this apparent irregularity, the pairing time of
every species is bound by an unfailing law; it sets in earlier or
later, according as the period of gestation lasts longer or shorter,
so that the young may be born at the time when they are most likely to
survive. Thus, most Mammals bring forth their young early in spring,
or, in tropical countries, at the beginning of the rainy season; the
period then commences when life is more easily sustained, when prey
is most abundant, when there is enough water and vegetable food, and
when the climate becomes warmer. In the highlands, animals pair later
than those living in lower regions,[127] whilst those of the polar
and temperate zones generally pair later than those of the tropics.
As regards the species living in different latitudes the pairing time
comes earlier or later, according to the differences in climate.[128]

Far from depending upon any general physiological law, the rut is
thus adapted to the requirements of each species separately. Here
again we have an example of the powerful effects of natural selection,
often showing themselves very obviously. The dormouse (_Muscardinus
avellanarius_), for instance, that feeds upon hazel-nuts, pairs in
July, and brings forth its young in August, when nuts begin to ripen.
Then the young grow very quickly, so that they are able to bear the
autumn and winter cold.[129]

There are, however, a few wild species, as some whales,[130]
the elephant,[131] many Rodents,[132] and several of the lower
monkeys,[133] that seem to have no definite pairing season. As to
them it is, perhaps, sufficient to quote Dr. Brehm’s statement with
reference to the elephant, “The richness of their woods is so great,
that they really never suffer want.”[134] But the man-like apes do not
belong to this class. According to Mr. Winwood Reade, the male Gorillas
fight at the rutting season for their females;[135] Dr. Mohnike, as
also other authorities, mentions the occurrence of a rut-time with the
Orang-utan.[136] And we find that both of these species breed early in
the season when fruits begin to be plentiful,—that is, their pairing
time depends on the same law as that which prevails in the rest of the
animal kingdom.

Sir Richard Burton says, “The Gorilla breeds about December, a cool
and dry month; according to my bushmen, the period of gestation is
between five and six months.”[137] I have referred this important
statement to Mr. Alfred R. Wallace, who writes as follows: “From the
maps of rain distribution in Africa in Stanford’s ‘Compendium,’ the
driest months in the Gorilla country seem to be January and February,
and these would probably be the months of greatest fruit supply.” As
regards the Orang-utan, Mr. Wallace adds, “I found the young sucking
Orang-utan in May; that was about the second or third month of the dry
season, in which fruits began to be plentiful.”

Considering, then, that the periodicity of the sexual life rests
on the kind of food on which the species lives, together with
other circumstances connected with anatomical and physiological
peculiarities, and considering, further, the close biological
resemblance between man and the man-like apes, we are almost compelled
to assume that the pairing time of our earliest human or half-human
ancestors was restricted to a certain season of the year, as was also
the case with their nearest relations among the lower animals. This
presumption derives further probability from there being, even now,
some rude peoples who are actually stated to have an annual pairing
time, and other peoples whose sexual instinct undergoes most decidedly
a periodical increase at a certain time of the year.

According to Mr. Johnston, the wild Indians of California, belonging to
the lowest races on earth, “have their rutting seasons as regularly
as have the deer, the elk, the antelope, or any other animals.”[138]
And Mr. Powers confirms the correctness of this statement, at least
with regard to some of these Indians, saying that spring “is a literal
Saint Valentine’s Day with them, as with the natural beasts and birds
of the forest.”[139]

As regards the Goddanes in Luzon, Mr. Foreman tells us that “it is
the custom of the young men about to marry, to vie with each other
in presenting to the sires of their future bride all the scalps they
are able to take from their enemies, as proof of their manliness
and courage. This practice prevails at the season of the year when
the tree—popularly called by the Spaniards ‘the fire-tree’—is in
bloom.”[140]

Speaking of the Watch-an-dies in the western part of Australia, Mr.
Oldfield remarks, “Like the beasts of the field, the savage has
but one time for copulation in the year.[141] About the middle of
spring ... the Watch-an-dies begin to think of holding their grand
semi-religious festival of Caa-ro, preparatory to the performance of
the important duty of procreation.”[142] A similar feast, according to
Mr. Bonwick, was celebrated by the Tasmanians at the same time of the
year.[143]

The Hos, an Indian hill tribe, have, as we are informed by Colonel
Dalton, every year a great feast in January, “when the granaries are
full of grain, and the people, to use their own expression, full of
devilry. They have a strange notion that at this period, men and women
are so over-charged with vicious propensities, that it is absolutely
necessary for the safety of the person to let off steam by allowing for
a time full vent to the passions. The festival, therefore, becomes a
saturnalia, during which servants forget their duty to their masters,
children their reverence for parents, men their respect for women,
and women all notions of modesty, delicacy, and gentleness.” Men and
women become almost like animals in the indulgence of their amorous
propensities, and the utmost liberty is given to the girls.[144]

The same writer adds that “it would appear that most Hill Tribes have
found it necessary to promote marriage by stimulating intercourse
between the sexes at particular seasons of the year.”[145] Among the
Santals, “the marriages mostly take place once a year, in January;
for six days all the candidates for matrimony live in promiscuous
concubinage, after which the whole party are supposed to have
paired off as man and wife.”[146] The Punjas in Jeypore, according
to Dr. Shortt, have a festival in the first month of the new year,
where men and women assemble. The lower order or castes observe
this festival, which is kept up for a month, by both sexes mixing
promiscuously, and taking partners as their choice directs.[147]
A similar feast, comprising a continuous course of debauchery and
licentiousness, is held once a year, by the Kotars, a tribe inhabiting
the Neilgherries;[148] according to Mr. Bancroft, by the Keres in
New Mexico;[149] according to Dr. Fritsch, by the Hottentots;[150]
according to the Rev. H. Rowley, by the Kafirs;[151] and, as I am
informed by Mr. A. J. Swann, by some tribes near Nyassa. Writers of the
sixteenth century speak of the existence of certain early festivals in
Russia, at which great license prevailed. According to Pamphill, these
annual gatherings took place, as a rule, at the end of June, the day
before the festival of St. John the Baptist, which, in pagan times, was
that of a divinity known by the name of Jarilo, corresponding to the
Priapus of the Greeks.[152] At Rome, a festival in honour of Venus took
place in the month of April;[153] and Mannhardt mentions some curious
popular customs in Germany, England, Esthonia and other European
countries, which seem to indicate an increase of the sexual instinct in
spring or at the beginning of summer.[154]

By questions addressed to persons living among various savage peoples,
I have inquired whether among these peoples, marriages are principally
contracted at a certain time of the year, and whether more children are
born in one month or season than in another. In answer, Mr. Radfield
writes from Lifu, near New Caledonia, that marriages there formerly
took place at various times, when suitable, but “November used to be
the time at which engagements were made.” As the seasons in this island
are the reverse of those in England, this month includes the end of
spring and the beginning of summer. The Rev. H. T. Cousins informs
me that, among the Kafirs inhabiting what is known as Cis-Natalian
Kafirland, “there are more children born in one month or season
than in another, _viz._ August and September, which are the spring
months in South Africa;” and he ascribes this surplus of births to
feasts, comprising debauchery and unrestricted intercourse between the
unmarried people of both sexes. Again, Dr. A. Sims writes from Stanley
Pool that, among the Bateke, more children are born in September and
October, that is, in the seasons of the early rains, than at other
times; and the Rev. Ch. E. Ingham, writing from Banza Manteka, states
that he believes the same to be the case among the Bakongo. But the
Rev. T. Bridges informs me that, among the Yahgans in the southern
part of Tierra del Fuego, so far as he knows, one month is the same as
another with regard to the number of births. I venture, however, to
think that this result might be somewhat modified by a minute inquiry,
embracing a sufficient number of cases. For statistics prove that even
in civilized countries, there is a regular periodical fluctuation in
the birth-rate.

In the eighteenth century Wargentin showed that, in Sweden more
children were born in one month than in another.[155] The same has
since been found to be the case in other European countries. According
to Wappäus, the number of births in Sardinia, Belgium, Holland, and
Sweden is subject to a regular increase twice a year, the maximum
of the first increase occurring in February or March, that of the
second in September and October.[156] M. Sormani observed that, in the
south of Italy, there is an increase only once in the year, but more
to the north twice, in spring and in autumn.[157] Dr. Mayr and Dr.
Beukemann found in Germany two annual maxima—in February or March, and
in September;—[158]and Dr. Haycraft states that, in the eight largest
towns of Scotland, more children are born in legitimate wedlock in
April than in any other month.[159] As a rule, according to M. Sormani,
the first annual augmentation of births has its maximum, in Sweden, in
March; in France and Holland, between February and March; in Belgium,
Spain, Austria and Italy, in February; in Greece, in January; so that
it comes earlier in southern Europe than farther to the north.[160]
Again, the second annual increase is found more considerable the more
to the north we go. In South Germany it is smaller than the first
one, but in North Germany generally larger;[161] and in Sweden, it is
decidedly larger.[162]

As to non-European countries, Wappäus observed that in Massachusetts,
the birth-rate likewise underwent an increase twice a year, the
maxima falling in March and September; and that in Chili many more
children were born in September and October—_i.e._, at the beginning
of spring—than in any other month.[163] Finally, Mr. S. A. Hill, of
Allahabad, has proved, by statistical data, that, among the Hindus
of that province, the birth-rates exhibit a most distinct annual
variation, the minimum falling in June and the maximum in September and
October.[164]

This unequal distribution of births over the different months of the
year is ascribed to various causes by statisticians. It is, however,
generally admitted that the maximum in February and March (in Chili,
September) is, at least to a great extent, due to the sexual instinct
being strongest in May and June (in Chili, December).[165] This is the
more likely to be the case as it is especially illegitimate births that
are then comparatively numerous. And it appears extremely probable
that, in Africa also, the higher birth-rates in the seasons of the
early rains owe their origin to the same cause.

Thus, comparing the facts stated, we find, among various races of men,
the sexual instinct increasing at the end of spring, or, rather, at the
beginning of summer. Some peoples of India seem to form an exception to
this rule, lascivious festivals, in the case of several of them, taking
place in the month of January, and the maximum of births, among the
Hindus of Allahabad, falling at the end of the hot season, or in early
autumn. But in India also there are traces of strengthened passions in
spring. M. Rousselet gives the following description of the indecent
Holi festival, as it is celebrated among the Hindus of Oudeypour. “The
festival of Holi marks the arrival of spring, and is held in honour
of the goddess Holica, or Vasanti, who personifies that season in the
Hindu Pantheon. The carnival lasts several days, during which time the
most licentious debauchery and disorder reign throughout every class of
society. It is the regular saturnalia of India. Persons of the greatest
respectability, without regard to rank or age, are not ashamed to take
part in the orgies which mark this season of the year.... Women and
children crowd round the hideous idols of the feast of Holica, and
deck them with flowers; and immorality reigns supreme in the streets
of the capital.”[166] Among the Aryans who inhabited the plains of the
North, the spring, or “vasanta,” corresponding to the months of March
and April, was the season of love and pleasure, celebrated in song by
the poets, and the time for marriages and religious feasts.[167] And
among the Rajputs of Mewar, according to Lieutenant-Colonel Tod, the
last days of spring are dedicated to Camdéva, the god of love: “the
scorching winds of the hot season are already beginning to blow, when
Flora droops her head, and the ‘god of love turns anchorite.’”[168]

We must not, however, infer that this enhancement of the procreative
power is to be attributed directly to “the different positions of
the sun with respect to the earth,”[169] or to the temperature of
a certain season. The phenomenon does not immediately spring from
this cause in the case of any other animal species. Neither can it
be due to abundance of food. In the northern parts of Europe many
more conceptions take place in the months of May and June, when the
conditions of life are often rather hard, than in September, October,
and November, when the supplies of food are comparatively plentiful.
In the north-western provinces of Germany, as well as in Sweden, the
latter months are characterized by a minimum of conceptions.[170] Among
the Kaffirs, more children are conceived in November and December than
in any other month, although, according to the Rev. H. T. Cousins,
food is most abundant among them from March to September. And among
the Bateke, the maximum of conceptions falls in December and January,
although food is, as I am informed by Dr. Sims, most plentiful in the
dry season, that is, from May to the end of August.

On the other hand, the periodical increase of conceptions cannot
be explained by the opposite hypothesis, entertained by some
physiologists, that the power of reproduction is increased by want
and distress. Among the Western Australians and Californians,[171]
for instance, the season of love is accompanied by a surplus of food,
and in the land of the Bakongo, among whom Mr. Ingham believes most
conceptions to take place in December and January, food is, according
to him, most abundant precisely in these months and in February.

It seems, therefore, a reasonable presumption that the increase of the
sexual instinct at the end of spring or in the beginning of summer, is
a survival of an ancient pairing season, depending upon the same law
that rules in the rest of the animal kingdom. Since spring is rather
a time of want than a time of abundance for a frugivorous species,
it is impossible to believe that our early ancestors, as long as
they fed upon fruits, gave birth to their young at the beginning of
that period. From the statements of Sir Richard Burton and Mr. A. R.
Wallace, already quoted,[172] we know that the man-like apes breed
early in the season when fruits begin to be plentiful. But when man
began to feed on herbs, roots, and animal food, the conditions were
changed. Spring is the season of the re-awakening of life, when there
are plenty of vegetables and prey. Hence those children whose infancy
fell in this period survived more frequently than those born at any
other. Considering that the parents of at least a few of them must have
had an innate tendency to the increase of the power of reproduction at
the beginning of summer, and considering, further, that this tendency
must have been transmitted to some of the offspring, like many other
characteristics which occur periodically at certain seasons,[173]
we can readily understand that gradually, through the influence of
natural selection, a race would emerge whose pairing time would be
exclusively or predominantly restricted to the season most favourable
to its subsistence. To judge from the period when most children are
born among existing peoples, the pairing season of our prehistoric
ancestors occurred, indeed, somewhat earlier in the year than is the
case with the majority of mammalian species. But we must remember that
the infancy of man is unusually long; and, with regard to the time
most favourable to the subsistence of children, we must take into
consideration not only the first days of their existence, but the
first period of their infancy in general. Besides food and warmth,
several other factors affect the welfare of the offspring, and it is
often difficult to find out all of them. We do not know the particular
circumstances that make the badger breed at the end of February or the
beginning of March,[174] and the reindeer of the Norwegian mountains
as early as April;[175] but there can be no doubt that these breeding
seasons are adapted to the requirements of the respective species.

The cause of the winter maximum of conceptions, especially considerable
among the peoples of Northern Europe, is generally sought in social
influences, as the quiet ensuing on the harvest time, the better
food, and the amusements of Christmas.[176] But the people certainly
recover before December from the labours of the field, and Christmas
amusements, as Wargentin remarks, take place at the end of that month
and far into January, without any particular influence upon the number
of births in October being observable.[177] It has, further, been
proved that the unequal distribution of marriages over the different
months exercises hardly any influence upon the distribution of
births.[178] Again, among the Hindus the December and January maximum
of conceptions seems from the lascivious festivities of several Indian
peoples to be due to an increase of the sexual instinct. According
to Mr. Hill, this increase depends upon healthy conditions with an
abundant food supply. But, as I have already said, it is not proved
that a strengthened power of reproduction and abundance of food are
connected with one another.

I am far from venturing to express any definite opinion as to the cause
of these particular phenomena, but it is not impossible that they also
are effects of natural selection, although of a comparatively recent
date. Considering that the September maximum of births (or December
maximum of conceptions) in Europe becomes larger the farther north
we go; that the agricultural peoples of Northern Europe have plenty
of food in autumn and during the first part of winter, but often
suffer a certain degree of want in spring; and, finally, that the
winter cold does not affect the health of infants, the woods giving
sufficient material for fuel,—it has occurred to me that children born
in September may have a better chance of surviving than others. Indeed,
Dr. Beukemann states that the number of still-born births is largest in
winter or at the beginning of spring, and that “the children born in
autumn possess the greatest vitality and resisting power against the
dangers of earliest infancy.”[179] This would perhaps be an adequate
explanation either of an increase of the sexual instinct or of greater
disposition to impregnation in December. It is not impossible either,
that the increase of the power of reproduction among the Hindus in
December and January, which causes an increase of births in September
and October—_i.e._, the end of the hot season and the beginning
of winter—owes its origin to the fact that during the winter the
granaries get filled and some of the conditions of life become more
healthy. But it should be remarked that September itself, according to
Mr. Hill, is a very unhealthy month.[180]

Now it can be explained, I believe for the first time, how it happens
that man, unlike the lower animals, is not limited to a particular
period of the year in which to court the female.[181] The Darwinian
theory of natural selection can, as it seems to me, account for the
periodicity of the sexual instinct in such a rude race as the Western
Australians, among whom the mortality of children is so enormous
that the greater number of them do not survive even the first month
after birth,[182] and who inhabit a land pre-eminently unproductive
of animals and vegetables fitted to sustain human life, a land where,
“during the summer seasons, the black man riots in comparative
abundance, but during the rest of the year ... the struggle for
existence becomes very severe.”[183] The more progress man makes in
arts and inventions; the more he acquires the power of resisting
injurious external influences; the more he rids himself of the
necessity of freezing when it is cold, and starving when nature is less
lavish with food; in short, the more independent he becomes of the
changes of the seasons—the greater is the probability that children
born at one time of the year will survive as well, or almost as well,
as those born at any other. Variations as regards the pairing time,
always likely to occur occasionally, will do so the more frequently on
account of changed conditions of life, which directly or indirectly
cause variability of every kind;[184] and these variations will be
preserved and transmitted to following generations. Thus we can
understand how a race has arisen, endowed with the ability to procreate
children in any season. We can also understand how, even in such a rude
race as the Yahgans in Tierra del Fuego, the seasonable distribution
of births seems to be pretty equal, as there is, according to the Rev.
T. Bridges, “such a variety of food in the various seasons that there
is strictly no period of hardship, save such as is caused by accidents
of weather.” We can explain, too, why the periodical fluctuation in
the number of births, though comparatively inconsiderable in every
civilized society, is greater in countries predominantly agricultural,
such as Chili, than in countries predominantly industrial, as
Saxony;[185] why it is greater in rural districts than in towns;[186]
and why it was greater in Sweden in the middle of the last century than
it is now.[187] For the more man has abandoned natural life out of
doors, the more luxury has increased and his habits have got refined,
the greater is the variability to which his sexual life has become
subject, and the smaller has been the influence exerted upon it by the
changes of the seasons.

Man has thus gone through the same transition as certain domestic
animals. The he-goat[188] and the ass in southern countries,[189]
for instance, rut throughout the whole year. The domestic pig pairs
generally twice a year, while its wild ancestors had but one rutting
season.[190] Dr. Hermann Müller has even observed a canary that laid
eggs in autumn and winter.[191] Natural selection cannot, of course,
account for such alterations: they fall under the law of variation.
It is the limited pairing season that is a product of this powerful
process, which acts with full force only under conditions free from
civilization and domestication.

If the hypothesis set forth in this chapter holds good, it must be
admitted that the continued excitement of the sexual instinct could not
have played a part in the origin of human marriage—provided that this
institution did exist among primitive men. Whether this was the case I
shall examine in the following chapters.




CHAPTER III

THE ANTIQUITY OF HUMAN MARRIAGE


If it be admitted that marriage, as a necessary requirement for the
existence of certain species, is connected with some peculiarities
in their organism, and, more particularly among the highest monkeys,
with the paucity of their progeny and their long period of infancy,—it
must at the same time be admitted that, among primitive men, from
the same causes as among these animals, the sexes in all probability
kept together till after the birth of the offspring. Later on, when
the human race passed beyond its frugivorous stage and spread over
the earth, living chiefly on animal food, the assistance of an adult
male became still more necessary for the subsistence of the children.
Everywhere the chase devolves on the man, it being a rare exception
among savage peoples for a woman to engage in it.[192] Under such
conditions a family consisting of mother and young only, would
probably, as a rule, have succumbed.

It has, however, been suggested that, in olden times, the natural
guardian of the children was not the father, but the maternal
uncle.[193] This inference has been drawn chiefly from the common
practice of a nephew succeeding his mother’s brother in rank and
property. But sometimes the relation between the two is still more
intimate. “La famille Malaise proprement dite—le Sa-Mandei,—” says a
Dutch writer, as quoted by Professor Giraud-Teulon, “consiste dans
la mère et ses enfants: le père n’en fait point partie. Les liens de
parenté qui unissent ce dernier à ses frères et sœurs sont plus étrois
que ceux qui le rattachent à sa femme et à ses propres enfants. Il
continue même après son mariage à vivre dans sa famille maternelle;
c’est là qu’est son véritable domicile, et non pas dans la maison de
sa femme: il ne cesse pas de cultiver le champ de sa propre famille,
à travailler pour elle, et n’aide sa femme qu’accidentellement. Le
chef de la famille est ordinairement le frère aîné du côté maternel
(le mamak ou avunculus). De par ses droits et ses devoirs, c’est lui
le vrai père des enfants de sa sœur.”[194] As regards the mountaineers
of Georgia, especially the Pshaves, M. Kovalevsky states that, among
them, “le frère de la mère prend la place du père dans toutes les
circonstances où il s’agit de venger le sang répandu, surtout au cas de
meurtre commis sur la personne de son neveu.”[195] Among the Goajiro
Indians,[196] the Negroes of Bondo,[197] the Barea, and the Bazes,[198]
it is the mother’s brother who has the right of selling a girl to her
suitor. Touching the Kois, the Rev. John Cain says, “The maternal
uncle of any Koi girl has the right to bestow her hand on any one of
his sons, or any other suitable candidate who meets with his approval.
The father and the mother of the girl have no acknowledged voice in the
matter. A similar custom prevails amongst some of the Komâti (Vaiśya)
caste.”[199] Among the Savaras in India, the bridegroom has to give a
bullock not only to the girl’s father, but to the maternal uncle;[200]
whilst among the Creeks, the proxy of the suitor asked for the consent
of the uncles, aunts, and brothers of the young woman, “the father
having no voice or authority in the business.”[201]

But such cases are rare. Besides, most of them imply only that the
children in a certain way belong to the uncle, not that the father is
released from the obligation of supporting them. Even where succession
runs through females only, the father is nearly always certainly the
head of the family. Thus, for instance, in Melanesia, where the clan of
the children is determined by that of the mother, “the mother is,” to
quote Dr. Codrington, “in no way the head of the family. The house of
the family is the father’s, the garden is his, the rule and government
are his.”[202] Nor is there any reason to believe that it was generally
otherwise in former times. A man could not of course be the guardian
of his sister’s children, if he did not live in close connection with
them. But except in such a decidedly anomalous case as that of the
Malays, just referred to, this could scarcely happen unless marriages
were contracted between persons living closely together. Nowadays,
however, such marriages are usually avoided, and I shall endeavour
later on to show that they were probably also avoided by our remote
ancestors.

It might, further, be objected that the children were equally well or
better provided for, if not the fathers only, but all the males of
the tribe indiscriminately were their guardians. The supporters of
the hypothesis of promiscuity, and even other sociologists, as for
instance Herr Kautsky,[203] believe that this really was the case among
primitive men. According to them, the tribe or horde is the primary
social unit of the human race, and the family only a secondary unit,
developed in later times. Indeed, this assumption has been treated
by many writers, not as a more or less probable hypothesis, but as a
demonstrated truth. Yet the idea that a man’s children belong to the
tribe, has no foundation in fact. Everywhere we find the tribes or
clans composed of several families, the members of each family being
more closely connected with one another than with the rest of the
tribe. The family, consisting of parents, children, and often also
their next descendants, is a universal institution among existing
peoples.[204] And it seems extremely probable that, among our earliest
human ancestors, the family formed, if not the society itself, at least
the nucleus of it. As this is a question of great importance, I must
deal with it at some length.

Mr. Darwin remarks, “Judging from the analogy of the majority of the
Quadrumana, it is probable that the early ape-like progenitors of man
were likewise social.”[205] But it may be doubted whether Mr. Darwin
would have drawn this inference, had he taken into consideration the
remarkable fact that none of the monkeys most nearly allied to man can
be called social animals.

The solitary life of the Orang-utan has already been noted. As
regards Gorillas, Dr. Savage states that there is only one adult male
attached to each group;[206] and Mr. Reade says expressly that they
are not gregarious, though they sometimes seem to assemble in large
numbers.[207] Both Mr. Du Chaillu[208] and Herr von Koppenfels[209]
assure us likewise that the Gorilla generally lives in pairs or
families.

The same is the case with the Chimpanzee. “It is seldom,” Dr. Savage
says, “that more than one or two nests are seen upon the same tree or
in the same neighbourhood; five have been found, but it was an unusual
circumstance. They do not live in ‘villages’.... They are more often
seen in pairs than in gangs.... As seen here, they cannot be called
gregarious.”[210] This statement, confirmed or repeated by Mr. Du
Chaillu[211] and Professor Hartmann,[212] is especially interesting, as
the Chimpanzee resembles man also in his comparatively slight strength
and courage, so that a gregarious life might be supposed to be better
suited to this animal.

Mr. Spencer, however, has pointed out that not only size, strength,
and means of defence, but also the kind and distribution of food and
other factors must variously co-operate and conflict to determine how
far a gregarious life is beneficial, and how far a solitary life.[213]
Considering, then, that, according to Dr. Savage, the Chimpanzees are
more numerous in the season when the greatest number of fruits come to
maturity,[214] we may almost with certainty infer that the solitary
life generally led by this ape is due chiefly to the difficulty it
experiences in getting food at other times of the year.

Is it not, then, most probable that our fruit-eating human or
half-human ancestors, living on the same kind of food, and requiring
about the same quantities of it as the man-like apes, were not more
gregarious than they? It is likely, too, that subsequently, when man
became partly carnivorous, he continued, as a rule, this solitary
kind of life, or that gregariousness became his habit only in part.
“An animal of a predatory kind,” says Mr. Spencer, “which has prey
that can be caught and killed without help, profits by living alone:
especially if its prey is much scattered, and is secured by stealthy
approach or by lying in ambush. Gregariousness would here be a positive
disadvantage. Hence the tendency of large carnivores, and also of
small carnivores that have feeble and widely-distributed prey, to lead
solitary lives.”[215] It is, indeed, very remarkable that even now
there are savage peoples who live rather in separate families than in
tribes, and that most of these peoples belong to the very rudest races
in the world.[216]

“‘The wild or forest Veddahs,’” Mr. Pridham states, “build their
huts in trees, live in pairs, only occasionally assembling in greater
numbers, and exhibit no traces of the remotest civilization, nor
any knowledge of social rites.”[217] According to Mr. Bailey, the
Nilgala Veddahs, who are considered the wildest, “are distributed
through their lovely country in small septs, or families, occupying
generally caves in the rocks, though some have little bark huts. They
depend almost solely on hunting for their support, and hold little
communication even with each other.”[218]

In Tierra del Fuego, according to Bishop Stirling, family life is
exclusive. “Get outside the family,” he says, “and relationships are
doubtful, if not hostile. The bond of a common language is no security
for friendly offices.”[219] Commander Wilkes states likewise that the
Fuegians “appear to live in families and not in tribes, and do not
seem to acknowledge any chief;[220]” and, according to M. Hyades, “la
famille est bien constitutée, mais la tribu n’existe pas, à proprement
parler.”[221] Each family is perfectly independent of all the others,
and only the necessity of common defence now and then induces a few
families to form small gangs without any chief.[222] The Rev. T.
Bridges writes to me, “They live in clans, called by them Ucuhr,
which means a house. These Ucuhr comprise many subdivisions; and the
members are necessarily related. But,” he continues, “the Yahgans are
a roving people, having their districts and moving about within these
districts from bay to bay and island to island in canoes, without any
order. The whole clan seldom travels together, and only occasionally
and then always incidentally is it to be found collected. The smaller
divisions keep more together.... Occasionally, as many as five families
are to be found living in a wigwam, but generally two families.”
Indeed, in ‘A Voice for South America,’ Mr. Bridges says that “family
influence is the one great tie which binds these natives together, and
the one great preventive of violence.”[223]

Speaking of the West Australians, who are probably better known to him
than to any other civilized man, Bishop Salvado says that they “au
lieu de se gouverner par tribus, paraissent se gouverner à la manière
patriarchale: chaque famille, qui généralement ne compte pas plus de
six à neuf individus, forme comme une petite société, sous la seule
dépendance de son propre chef.... Chaque famille s’approprie une espèce
de district, dont cependant les families voisines jouissent en commun
si l’on vit en bonne harmonie.”[224]

Mr. Stanbridge, who spent eighteen years in the wilds of Victoria,
tells us that the savages there are associated in tribes or families,
the members of which vary much in number. Each tribe has its own
boundaries, the land of which is parcelled out amongst families and
carefully transmitted by direct descent; these boundaries being so
sacredly maintained that the member of no single family will venture on
the lands of a neighbouring one without invitation.[225] And touching
the Gournditch-mara, Mr. Howitt states that “each family camped by
itself.”[226]

The Bushmans of South Africa, according to Dr. Fritsch, are almost
entirely devoid of a tribal organization. Even when a number of
families occasionally unite in a larger horde, this association is more
or less accidental, and not regulated by any laws.[227] But a horde
commonly consists of the different members of one family only, at least
if the children are old and strong enough to help their parents to find
food.[228] “Sexual feelings, the instinctive love to children, or the
customary attachment among relations,” says Lichtenstein, “are the
only ties that keep them in any sort of union.”[229]

The like is stated to be true of several peoples in Brazil. According
to v. Martius, travellers often meet there with a language “used only
by a few individuals connected with each other by relationship, who
are thus completely isolated, and can hold no communication with any
of their other countrymen far or near.”[230] With reference to the
Botocudos, v. Tschudi says that “the family is the only tie which
joins these rude children of nature with each other.”[231] The Guachís,
Mauhés, and Guatós for the most part live scattered in families,[232]
and the social condition of the Caishánas, among whom each family has
its own solitary hut, “is of a low type, very little removed, indeed,
from that of the brutes living in the same forests.”[233] The Marauá
Indians live likewise in separate families or small hordes, and so
do some other of the tribes visited by Mr. Bates.[234] According to
Mr. Southey, the Cayáguas or Wood-Indians, who inhabited the forests
between the Paraná and the Uruguay, were not in a social state; “one
family lived at a distance from another, in a wretched hut composed of
boughs; they subsisted wholly by prey, and when larger game failed,
were contented with snakes, mice, pismires, worms, and any kind of
reptile or vermin.”[235] Again, speaking of the Coroados, v. Spix and
v. Martius say that “they live without any bond of social union,
neither under a republican nor a patriarchal form of government. Even
family ties are very loose among them.”[236]

The Togiagamutes, an Eskimo tribe, never visited by white men in
their own country until the year 1880, who lead a thoroughly nomadic
life, wandering from place to place in search of game or fish,
appear, according to Petroff, “to live in the most perfect state of
independence of each other. Even the communities do not seem bound
together in any way; families and groups of families constantly
changing their abode, leaving one community and joining another, or
perhaps forming one of their own. The youth, as soon as he is able to
build a kaiak and to support himself, no longer observes any family
ties, but goes where his fancy takes him, frequently roaming about with
his kaiak for thousands of miles before another fancy calls him to take
a wife, to excavate a miserable dwelling, and to settle down for a
time.”[237]

The ancient Finns, too, according to the linguistic researches of
Professor Ahlqvist, were without any kind of tribal organization. In
his opinion, such a state would have been almost impossible among them,
as they lived in scattered families for the sake of the chase and in
order to have pastures for their reindeer.[238]

That the comparatively solitary life which the families of these
peoples live, is due to want of sufficient food, appears from several
facts. Lichtenstein tells us that the hardships experienced by the
Bushmans in satisfying the most urgent necessities of life, preclude
the possibility of their forming larger societies. Even the families
that form associations in small separate hordes are sometimes obliged
to disperse, as the same spot will not afford sufficient sustenance
for all. “The smaller the number, the easier is a supply of food
procured.”[239]

“Scarcity of food, and the facility with which they move from one
place to another in their canoes,” says Admiral Fitzroy, “are, no
doubt, the reasons why the Fuegians are always so dispersed among the
islands in small family parties, why they never remain long in one
place, and why a large number are not seen many days in society.”[240]

The natives of Port Jackson, New South Wales, when visited a hundred
years ago by Captain Hunter, were associated in tribes of many
families living together, apparently without a fixed residence, the
different families wandering in different directions for food, but
uniting on occasions of disputes with another tribe.[241] The Rev. A.
Meyer assures us likewise, as regards the Encounter Bay tribe, that
“the whole tribe does not always move in a body from one place to
another, unless there should be abundance of food to be obtained at
some particular spot; but generally they are scattered in search of
food.”[242] Again, with reference to the Australians more generally,
Mr. Brough Smyth remarks that “in any large area occupied by a tribe,
where there was not much forest land, and where kangaroos were not
numerous, it is highly probable that the several families composing
the tribe would withdraw from their companions for short periods, at
certain seasons, and betake themselves to separate portions of the
area, ... and it is more than probable—it is almost certain—that each
head of a family would betake himself, if practicable, to that portion
which his father had frequented.”[243]

Finally, from Mr. Wyeth’s account in Schoolcraft’s great work on
the Indian Tribes of the United States, I shall make the following
characteristic quotation with reference to the Snakes inhabiting the
almost desert region which extends southward from the Snake River as
far as the southern end of the Great Salt Lake, and eastward from the
Rocky to the Blue Mountains:—“The paucity of game in this region
is, I have little doubt, the cause of the almost entire absence of
social organization among its inhabitants; no trace of it is ordinarily
seen among them, except during salmon-time, when a large number of
the Snakes resort to the rivers, chiefly to the Fishing Falls, and
at such places there seems some little organization.... Prior to the
introduction of the horse, no other tribal arrangement existed than
such as is now seen in the management of the salmon fishery.... The
organization would be very imperfect, because the remainder of the
year would be spent by them in families widely spread apart, to eke
out the year’s subsistence on the roots and limited game of their
country. After a portion of them, who are now called Bonaks, had
obtained horses, they would naturally form bands and resort to the
Buffalo region to gain their subsistence, retiring to the most fertile
places in their own, to avoid the snows of the mountains and feed their
horses. Having food from the proceeds of the Buffalo hunt, to enable
them to live together, they would annually do so, for the protection
of their horses, lodges, &c., &c. These interests have caused an
organization among the Bonaks, which continues the year through,
because the interests which produce it continue; and it is more
advanced than that of the other Snakes.”[244]

Here, I think, we have an excellent account of the origin of society,
applicable not only to the Snakes, but, in its main features, to man
in general. The kind of food he subsisted upon, together with the
large quantities of it that he wanted, probably formed in olden times
a hindrance to a true gregarious manner of living, except perhaps in
some unusually rich places. Man in the savage state, even when living
in luxuriant countries, is often brought to the verge of starvation, in
spite of his having implements and weapons which his ruder ancestors
had no idea of. If the obstacle from insufficient food-supply could
be overcome, gregariousness would no doubt be of great advantage
to him. Living together, the families could resist the dangers of
life and defend themselves from their enemies much more easily than
when solitary,—all the more so, as the physical strength of man, and
especially savage man,[245] is comparatively slight. Indeed, his bodily
inferiority, together with his defencelessness and helplessness, has
probably been the chief lever of civilization.

“He has,” to quote Mr. Darwin, “invented and is able to use various
weapons, tools, traps, &c., with which he defends himself, kills or
catches prey, and otherwise obtains food. He has made rafts or canoes
for fishing or crossing over to neighbouring fertile islands. He has
discovered the art of making fire, by which hard and stringy roots can
be rendered digestible, and poisonous roots or herbs innocuous.”[246]
In short, man gradually found out many new ways of earning his living
and more and more emancipated himself from direct dependence on
surrounding nature. The chief obstacle to a gregarious life was by this
means in part surmounted, and the advantages of such a life induced
families or small gangs to unite together in larger bodies. Thus it
seems that the gregariousness and sociability of man sprang, in the
main, from progressive intellectual and material civilization, whilst
the tie that kept together husband and wife, parents and children, was,
if not the only, at least the principal social factor in the earliest
life of man. I cannot, therefore, agree with Sir John Lubbock that, as
a general rule, as we descend in the scale of civilization, the family
diminishes, and the tribe increases, in importance.[247] This may hold
good for somewhat higher stages, but it does not apply to the lowest
stages. Neither do I see any reason to believe that there _ever_ was a
time when the family was quite absorbed in the tribe. There does not
exist a single well established instance of a people among whom this is
the case.

I do not, of course, deny that the tie which bound the children to the
mother was much more intimate and more lasting than that which bound
them to the father. But it seems to me that the only result to which a
critical investigation of facts can lead us is, that in all probability
there has been no stage of human development when marriage has not
existed, and that the father has always been, as a rule, the protector
of his family. Human marriage appears, then, to be an inheritance from
some ape-like progenitor.




CHAPTER IV

A CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY


The inference drawn in the last chapter is opposed to the view held
by most sociologists who have written upon early history. According
to them, man lived originally in a state of promiscuity. This is the
opinion of Bachofen, McLennan, Morgan, Lubbock, Bastian, Giraud-Teulon,
Lippert, Kohler, Post, Wilken, and several other writers.[248] Although
suggested at first only as a probable hypothesis, this presumption is
now treated by many writers as a demonstrated truth.[249]

The promiscuity of primitive man is not, however, generally considered
to be perfectly indiscriminate, but limited to the individuals
belonging to the same tribe. It may, therefore, perhaps be said to be
a kind of marriage: polygyny combined with polyandry. Sir John Lubbock
has also given it the name of “communal marriage,” indicating by
this word, that all the men and women in a community were regarded as
equally husbands and wives to one another. As I do not, in speaking of
marriage, take into consideration unions of so indefinite a nature,
this seems to be the proper place to discuss the hypothesis in question.

The evidence adduced in support of it flows from two sources. First,
there are, in the books of ancient writers and modern travellers,
notices of some savage nations said to live promiscuously; secondly,
there are some remarkable customs which are assumed to be social
survivals, pointing to an earlier stage of civilization, when marriage
did not exist. Let us see whether this evidence will stand the test of
a critical examination.
