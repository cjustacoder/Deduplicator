ily becomes pregnant
during the time of lactation, but also on account of the continence
in which she often has to live during that period. The mortality of
children is very great among savages,[3100] and this, co-operating with
other causes to keep the family small, makes polygyny seem to many
peoples absolutely necessary. Speaking of the Equatorial Africans, Mr.
Reade says, “Propagation is a perfect struggle; polygamy becomes a law
of nature; and even with the aid of this institution, so favourable to
reproduction, there are fewer children than wives.”[3101]

A man’s fortune is increased by a multitude of wives not only through
their children, but through their labour. An Eastern Central African,
says Mr. Macdonald, finds no difficulty in supporting even hundreds of
wives. “The more wives he has, the richer he is. It is his wives that
maintain him. They do all his ploughing, milling, cooking, &c. They
may be viewed as superior servants who combine all the capacities of
male servants and female servants in Britain—who do all his work and
ask no wages.”[3102] Manual labour among savages is undertaken chiefly
by women; and, as there are no day-labourers or persons who will work
for hire, it becomes necessary for any one who requires many servants
to have many wives. Mr. Wood remarks that, when an Indian can purchase
four or five wives, their labour in the field is worth even more to
the household than his exertions in hunting.[3103] “The object of
the Kutchin,” says Mr. Kirby, “is to have a greater number of poor
creatures whom he can use as beasts of burden for hauling his wood,
carrying his meat, and performing the drudgery of his camp.”[3104] A
Modok defends his having several wives on the plea that he requires
one to keep house, another to hunt, another to dig roots.[3105] In the
Solomon Islands in New Guinea, at the Gold Coast, and in other places
where the women cultivate the ground, a plurality of wives implies a
rich supply of food;[3106] whilst, among the Tartars, according to
Marco Polo, wives were of use to their husbands as traders.[3107]

A multitude of wives increases a man’s authority, not only because it
increases his fortune and the number of his children, or because it
makes him able to be liberal and keep open doors for foreigners and
guests,[3108] but also because it presupposes a certain superiority
in personal capabilities, wealth, or rank. Statements such as “a
man’s greatness is ever proportionate to the number of his wives,” or
“polygamy is held to be the test of his wealth and consequence,” are
very frequently met with in books of travels. Thus the Apache “who can
support or keep, or attract by his power to keep, the greatest number
of women, is the man who is deemed entitled to the greatest amount of
honour and respect.”[3109]

However desirable polygyny may be from man’s point of view, it is,
as we have seen, altogether prohibited among many peoples, and, in
countries where it is an established institution, it is practised, as a
rule to which there are few exceptions, only by a comparatively small
class. The proportion between the sexes partly accounts for this. But
there are other causes of no less importance.

In ethnographical descriptions it is very often stated that a man
takes as many wives as he is able to maintain. Where the amount of
female labour is limited, where life is supported by hunting, where
agriculture is unknown, and no accumulated property worth mentioning
exists, it may be extremely difficult for a man to keep a plurality of
wives. Among the Patagonians, for instance, it is chiefly those who
possess some property who take more than one wife.[3110] Regarding
the Tuski, Mr. Hooper states that “each man has as many wives as
he can afford to keep, the question of food being the greatest
consideration.”[3111] In Oonalashka, according to v. Langsdorf, a
man who had many wives, if his means decreased, sent first one, then
another back to their parents.[3112]

Again, where female labour is of considerable value, the necessity
of paying the purchase-sum for a wife very often makes the poorer
people content with monogamy. Thus among the Zulus, Mr. Eyles writes,
many men have but one wife because cattle have to be paid for women.
Among the Gonds and Korkús, according to Mr. Forsyth, “polygamy
is not forbidden, but, women being costly chattels, it is rarely
practised.”[3113] Among the Bechuanas, says Andersson, there is no
limit, but his means of purchase, to the number of wives a man may
possess.[3114] And the same is observed with reference to a great many
other peoples, especially in Africa, where the woman-trade is at its
height. Polygyny is, moreover, checked to some extent by the man’s
obligation to serve for his wife for a certain number of years, and
even more by his having to settle down with his father-in-law for the
whole of his life.

So far as the woman is allowed to choose, she prefers, other things
being equal, the man who is best able to support her, or the man of the
greatest wealth or highest position. Naturally, therefore, wherever
polygyny prevails, it is the principal men—whether they owe their
position to birth, skill, or acquired wealth—who have the largest
number of wives; or it may be that they alone have more than one wife.
Speaking of the Ainos of Yesso, Commander H. C. St. John says that a
successful or expert hunter or fisher sometimes keeps two wives; and,
if a woman finds her husband an unsuccessful Nimrod, she abandons
him.[3115] Among the Aleuts, “the number of wives was not limited,
except that the best hunters had the greatest number.”[3116] Among the
Kutchin, “polygamy is practised generally in proportion to the rank
and wealth of the man;”[3117] and, among the Brazilian aborigines and
the Araucanians, polygyny occurs only or chiefly among rich men and
chiefs.[3118] Touching the Equatorial Africans, Mr. Reade remarks,
“The bush-man can generally afford but one wife, who must find him
his daily bread.... But the rich man can indulge in the institutions
of polygamy and domestic slavery.”[3119] In Dahomey, as we are told,
“the king has thousands of wives, the nobles hundreds, others tens;
while the soldier is unable to support one.”[3120] In the New Hebrides,
polygyny prevails especially among the chiefs; in Naiabui of New
Guinea, “the head men only have more than two or three wives;” and, in
South Australia, “the old men secure the greatest number.”[3121]

Thus polygyny has come to be associated with greatness, and is
therefore, as Mr. Spencer remarks, thought praiseworthy, while
monogamy, as associated with poverty, is thought mean.[3122] Indeed,
plurality of wives has everywhere tended to become a more or less
definite class distinction, the luxury being permitted, among some
peoples, only to chiefs or nobles.

One of the most important of the influences which determine the form of
marriage is the position of women, or rather the respect in which they
are held by men. For polygyny implies a violation of woman’s feelings.

Several statements tend to show that jealousy and rivalry do not
always disturb the peace in polygynous families. It sometimes happens
that the first wife herself brings her husband a fresh wife or a
concubine, or advises him to take one, when she becomes old herself,
or if she proves barren, or has a suckling child, or for some other
reason.[3123] In Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Reade, the women
are the stoutest supporters of polygyny:—“If a man marries,” he says,
“and his wife thinks that he can afford another spouse, she pesters
him to marry again, and calls him ‘a stingy fellow’ if he declines to
do so.”[3124] Speaking of the Makalolo women, Livingstone observes,
“On hearing that a man in England could marry but one wife, several
ladies exclaimed that they would not like to live in such a country:
they could not imagine how English ladies could relish our custom, for,
in their way of thinking, every man of respectability should have a
number of wives, as a proof of his wealth. Similar ideas prevail all
down the Zambesi.”[3125] Among the Californian Modok also, according
to the Hon. A. B. Meacham, the women are opposed to any change in the
polygynous habits of the men.[3126] But such statements may easily
be misinterpreted. Often the wives live peacefully together only in
consequence of the strict discipline of the husband.[3127] They put up
with polygyny, thanks to long custom; they even approve of it where
it procures them advantages. The consideration of the whole family,
and especially of the first wife, is increased by every new marriage
the husband concludes.[3128] Where the wife is her husband’s slave,
polygyny implies a greater division of labour. This is the reason
why, among the Apaches, the women do not object to it; why, among the
Bagobos of the Philippines, they rejoice at the arrival of a new wife;
why, in the Mohammedan East, they themselves encourage the husband to
marry more wives.[3129] Among the Arabs of Upper Egypt, says Baker,
one of the conditions of accepting a suitor is, that a female slave
is to be provided for the special use of the wife, although the
slaves of the establishment occupy, at the same time, the position of
concubines.[3130] Von Weber tells us of a Kafir woman who, on account
of her heavy labour, passionately urged her husband to take another
wife.[3131] Nevertheless, polygyny is an offence against the feelings
of women, not only among highly civilized peoples, but even among the
rudest savages. For jealousy is not exclusively a masculine passion,
although it is generally more powerful in men than in women.[3132]

The Greenlanders have a saying that “whales, musk-oxen, and reindeer
deserted the country because the women were jealous at the conduct of
their husbands.”[3133] Regarding the Northern Indians, Hearne says,
“The men are in general very jealous of their wives, and I make no
doubt but the same spirit reigns among the women, but they are kept
so much in awe of their husbands, that the liberty of thinking is the
greatest privilege they enjoy.”[3134] Franklin tells us of an Indian
woman who committed suicide by hanging herself, in a fit of jealousy;
and another woman threw herself into the Mississippi with her child,
when her husband took a new wife.[3135] As regards the Dacotahs, Mr.
Prescott says that “polygamy is the cause of a great deal of their
miseries and troubles. The women, most of them, abhor the practice,
but are overruled by the men. Some of the women commit suicide on this
account.”[3136] The natives of Guiana, according to the Rev. W. H.
Brett, live in comfort, as long as the man is content with one wife,
but, when he takes another, “the natural feelings of woman rebel at
such cruel treatment, and jealousy and unhappiness have, in repeated
instances, led to suicide.”[3137] Among the Tamanacs, says v. Humboldt,
“the husband calls the second and third wife the ‘companions’ of
the first; and the first treats these ‘companions’ as rivals and
‘enemies’ (‘ipucjatoje’).”[3138] Among the Charruas, it often happens
that a woman abandons her husband if he has a plurality of wives, as
soon as she is able to find another man who will take her as his only
wife.[3139] And, when a Fuegian has as many as four women, his hut is
every day transformed into a field of battle, and many a young and
pretty wife must even atone with her life for the precedence given her
by the common husband.[3140]

In the islands of the Pacific similar scenes occur. The missionary
Williams’s wife once asked a Fiji woman who was _minus_ her nose, “How
is it that so many of your women are without a nose?” “It is due to
a plurality of wives,” was the answer; “jealousy causes hatred, and
then the stronger tries to cut or bite off the nose of the one she
hates.”[3141] In Tukopia, many a wife who believed another woman to be
preferred by the husband committed suicide.[3142] Among the Australian
aborigines, the old wives are extremely jealous of their younger
rivals, so that “a new woman would always be beaten by the other wife,
and a good deal would depend on the fighting powers of the former
whether she kept her position or not.”[3143] Among the Narrinyeri,
according to the Rev. A. Meyer, the several wives of one man very
seldom agree well with each other; they are continually quarrelling,
each endeavouring to be the favourite.[3144] “The black women,” says
Herr Lumholtz, “are also capable of being jealous.”[3145]

Among the Sea Dyaks, according to Sir Spenser St. John, the wife is
much more jealous of her husband than he is of her.[3146] In China,
many women dislike the idea of getting married, as they fear that,
should their husbands become polygynists, there would remain for them
a life of unhappiness. Hence, some become Buddhist or Taouist nuns,
and others prefer death by suicide to marriage.[3147] Mr. Balfour
asserts that, among the Mohammedans and ruling Hindu races who permit
and practise polygyny, it causes much intriguing and disquiet in
homes.[3148] According to Mr. Tod, it “is the fertile source of evil,
moral as well as physical, in the East.”[3149] The same view is taken
by Pischon and d’Escayrac de Lauture with regard to the polygyny of
the Mohammedans.[3150] In Persia, says Dr. Polak, a married woman
cannot feel a greater pain than if her husband takes a fresh wife, whom
he prefers to her; then she is quite disconsolate.[3151] In Egypt,
quarrels between the various women belonging to the same man are very
frequent, and often the wife will not even allow her female slave or
slaves to appear unveiled in the presence of her husband.[3152] In
the description, in the Book of Proverbs, of domestic happiness, it is
assumed that the husband has only one wife;[3153] and, in the latter
part of the ‘Rig-Veda,’ there are hymns in which wives curse their
fellow-wives.[3154]

The Abyssinian women are described as very jealous; and in the
polygynous families of the Eastern Africans, Zulus, Basutos, &c.,
quarrels frequently arise.[3155] The Hova word for polygyny is
derived from the root “ràfy,” which means “an adversary.” “So
invariably,” says the Rev. J. Sibree, “has the taking of more wives
than one shown itself to be a fruitful cause of enmity and strife in
a household, that this word, which means ‘the making an adversary,’
is the term always applied to it.... The different wives are always
trying to get an advantage over each other, and to wheedle their
husband out of his property; constant quarrels and jealousy are the
result, and polygamy becomes inevitably the causing of strife, ‘the
making an adversary.’”[3156] Statements of this kind cannot but shake
our confidence in the optimistic assertions of Dr. Le Bon and other
defenders of polygyny.[3157]

In order to prevent quarrels and fights between the wives, the husband
frequently gives each of them a separate house. It is probably in
part for the same reason that, among several peoples, wives are
usually chosen from one family. In general, says Domenech, when
an Indian wishes to have many wives, he chooses before all others,
if he can, sisters, because he thinks he can thus secure more
domestic peace.[3158] This is true of many of the North American
aborigines;[3159] a man who marries the eldest daughter of a family
secures in many cases the right to marry all her sisters as soon as
they are old enough to become his wives.[3160] The same practice is
said to prevail in Madagascar,[3161] and, combined with polyandry,
among certain peoples of India. But it is obvious that the evils of
polygyny are not removed by such arrangements.

Where women have succeeded in obtaining some power over their
husbands, or where the altruistic feelings of men have become refined
enough to lead them to respect the feelings of those weaker than
themselves, monogamy is generally considered the only proper form of
marriage. Among monogamous savage or barbarous races the position of
women is comparatively good; and the one phenomenon must be regarded
as partly the cause, partly the effect of the other. The purely
monogamous Iroquois, to quote Schoolcraft, are “the only tribes in
America, north and south, so far as we have any accounts, who gave
to woman a conservative power in their political deliberations. The
Iroquois matrons had their representative in the public councils;
and they exercised a negative, or what we call a veto power, in the
important question of the declaration of war. They had the right also
to interpose in bringing about a peace.”[3162] Moreover, they had
considerable privileges in the family.[3163] Among the Nicaraguans—a
people almost wholly monogamous,—the husbands are said to have been
so much under the control of their wives that they were obliged to do
the housework, while the women attended to the trading.[3164] Among
the Zapotecs and other nations inhabiting the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,
who do not permit polygyny, “gentleness, affection, and frugality
characterize the marital relations.”[3165] In New Hanover[3166] and
among the Dyaks,[3167] the wife seems to have a kind of authority;
and among the Minahassers, according to Dr. Hickson, “the woman is,
and probably has been for many generations, on a footing of equality
with her husband.”[3168] Mr. Man states that, in the Andaman Islands,
“the consideration and respect with which women are treated might
with advantage be emulated by certain classes in our own land.”[3169]
The Pádam wives are treated by their husbands with a regard that seems
singular in so rude a race. “But I have seen,” says Colonel Dalton,
“other races as rude who in this respect are an example to more
civilized people. It is because with these rude people the inclination
of the persons most interested in the marriage is consulted, and
polygamy is not practised.”[3170] The Munda Kols of Chota Nagpore
call a wife “the mistress of the house,” and she takes up a position
similar to that of a married woman in Europe.[3171] The Santal
women, who enjoy the advantage of reigning alone in the husband’s
wigwam, according to Mr. E. G. Man, hold a much higher _status_ in
the family circle than their less fortunate sisters in most Eastern
countries.[3172] The Kandhs, Bodo, and Dhimáls treat their wives
and daughters with confidence and kindness, and consult them in all
domestic concerns.[3173] Among the monogamous Moors of the Western
Soudan, the women exercise a considerable influence on the men, who
take the greatest pains to pay them homage.[3174] The Touareg wives’
authority is so great that, although Islam permits polygyny, the men
are forced to live in monogamy.[3175] Among the monogamous Tedâ, the
women hold a very high position in the family.[3176] As for European
monogamy, there can be no doubt that it owes its origin chiefly to the
consideration of men for the feelings of women.

The form of marriage is, further, influenced by the quality of the
passions which unites the sexes. When love depends entirely on external
attractions, it is necessarily fickle; but when it implies sympathy
arising from mental qualities, there is a tie between husband and wife
which lasts long after youth and beauty are gone.

It remains for us to note the true monogamous instinct, the absorbing
passion for one, as a powerful obstacle to polygyny. “The sociable
interest,” Professor Bain remarks, “is by its nature diffused: even
the maternal feeling admits of plurality of objects; revenge does
not desire to have but one victim; the love of domination needs many
subjects; but the greatest intensity of love limits the regards to
one.”[3177] The beloved person acquires, in the imagination of the
lover, an immeasurable superiority over all others. “The beginnings of
a special affection,” the same psychologist says, “turn upon a small
difference of liking; but such differences are easily exaggerated; the
feeling and the estimate acting and re-acting, till the distinction
becomes altogether transcendent.”[3178] This absorbing passion for one
is not confined to the members of civilized societies. It is found
also among savage peoples, and even among some of the lower animals.
Hermann Müller, Brehm, and other good observers have proved that
it is experienced by birds; and Mr. Darwin found it among certain
domesticated mammals.[3179] The love-bird rarely survives the death
of its companion, even when supplied with a fresh and suitable
mate.[3180] M. Houzeau states, on the authority of Frédéric Cuvier,
“Lorsque l’un des ouistitis (_Harpale jacchus_) du Jardin des Plantes
de Paris vint à mourir l’époux survivant fut inconsolable. Il caressa
longtemps le cadavre de sa compagne; et quand à la fin il fut convaincu
de la triste réalité, il se mit les mains sur les yeux, et resta sans
bouger et sans prendre de nourriture, jusqu’à ce qu’il eût lui-même
succombé.”[3181]

Among the Indians of Western Washington and North-Western Oregon, says
Dr. Gibbs, “a strong sensual attachment undoubtedly often exists,
which leads to marriage, as instances are not rare of young women
destroying themselves on the death of a lover.”[3182] The like is said
of other Indian tribes, in which suicide from unsuccessful love has
sometimes occurred even among men.[3183] Colonel Dalton represents the
Pahária lads and lasses as forming very romantic attachments; “if
separated only for an hour,” he says, “they are miserable.”[3184]
Davis tells us of a negro who, after vain attempts to redeem his
sweetheart from slavery, became a slave himself rather than be
separated from her.[3185] In Tahiti, unsuccessful suitors have been
known to commit suicide;[3186] and even the rude Australian girl sings
in a strain of romantic affliction—

  “I never shall see my darling again.”[3187]

As a man, under certain circumstances, desires many wives, so a woman
may have several reasons for desiring a plurality of husbands. But the
jealousy of man does not readily suffer any rivals, and, as he is the
stronger, his will is decisive. Hence, where polyandry occurs, it is
only exceptionally a result of the woman’s wishes.

Various causes have been adduced for this revolting practice.
The difficulty of raising the sum for a wife, and the expense of
maintaining women may perhaps in part account for it.[3188] Regarding
polyandry in Kunawar, the Rev. W. Rebsch says that the cause assigned
is not poverty, but a desire to keep the common patrimony from being
distributed among a number of brothers.[3189] Some writers believe
that polyandry subserves the useful end of preventing the woman from
being exposed to danger and difficulty, when she is left alone in her
remote home during the prolonged absences of her lord.[3190] According
to the Sinhalese, the practice originated in the so-called feudal
times, when the enforced attendance of the people on the king and the
higher chiefs would have led to the ruin of the rice lands, had not
some interested party been left to look after the tillage. But Sir
Emerson Tennent remarks that polyandry is much more ancient than the
system thus indicated: it is shown to have existed at a period long
antecedent to “feudalism.”[3191] To whatever other causes the practice
may be attributed, the chief immediate cause is, no doubt, a numerical
disproportion between the sexes.




CHAPTER XXII

THE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE

(_Concluded_)


As to the history of the forms of human marriage, two inferences
regarding monogamy and polygyny may be made with absolute certainty:
monogamy, always the predominant form of marriage, has been more
prevalent at the lowest stages of civilization than at somewhat higher
stages; whilst, at a still higher stage, polygyny has again, to a great
extent, yielded to monogamy.

As already said, wars, often greatly disturbing the proportion of
the sexes among peoples with a highly developed tribal organization,
exercise a much smaller influence in that respect in societies of a
ruder type. As in such societies all men are nearly equal, and, to
quote Mr. Wallace, “each man scrupulously respects the rights of
his fellow, and any infraction of those rights rarely or never takes
place,”[3192] no great scope is left for polygynous habits.

Plurality of wives has comparatively few attractions for the men of
rude communities, where life is supported chiefly by hunting, and
female labour is of slight value. In societies of a higher kind, the
case is different. True, in such societies a man has to buy his wife,
and women are often costly chattels; but this obstacle to polygyny
is more than counterbalanced by the accumulation of wealth and the
distinction of classes.

Nothing, indeed, is more favourable to polygyny than social
differentiation. “In its highest and regulated form,” Mr. Morgan
justly observes, “it presupposes a considerable advance of society,
together with the development of superior and inferior classes, and of
some kinds of wealth.”[3193] Speaking of the Iroquois, Colden long ago
remarked that, “in any nation where all are on a par as to riches and
power, plurality of wives cannot well be introduced.”[3194] According
to Waitz, the reason why polygyny is very rare among the Hottentots
is, that they do not know of any disparity in rank and wealth.[3195]
The Rock Veddahs have no class distinction, and, though each party
among them has a headman—the most energetic senior of the tribe,—he
exercises scarcely any authority.[3196] Almost the same may be said of
most of the monogamous savage peoples whom we have mentioned. Thus,
among the Pádams, all, except slaves, are equal in rank;[3197] and of
the Kukis it is said that all eat and drink together, and that “one
man is as good as another.”[3198] This is true of the Chittagong Hill
tribes in general, who enjoy a perfect social equality, their nomadic
life precluding any great accumulation of wealth.[3199] Among the
Hill Dyaks, as Mr. Spencer observes, chiefs are unable to enforce
genuine subordination; the headman of each Bodo and Dhimál village has
but nominal authority; and the governor of a Pueblo town is annually
elected.[3200] In Tana, where the authority of a chief does not seem
to extend a gunshot beyond his own dwelling, few chiefs have more than
three wives, and most of them have only one or two.[3201] On the other
hand, throughout Africa, polygyny and great class distinctions occur
simultaneously. We may therefore safely conclude that polygyny became
more prevalent in proportion as differentiation increased with the
progress of civilization.

It is a notable fact that the higher savages and barbarians indulge in
this practice to a greater extent than the very lowest races. These,
with few exceptions, are either strictly monogamous, or but little
addicted to polygyny. The lowest forest tribes in Brazil and the
interior of Borneo are monogamous. Among the Veddahs and Andamanese,
monogamy is as rigidly insisted upon as anywhere in Europe. According
to Captain Lewin, the monogamous Toungtha are “unamenable to the
lures of civilization,” and he thinks it will be found difficult, if
not impossible, to wean them from their savage life.[3202] The Mrús
are despised as wild men by the polygynous Khyoungtha;[3203] and the
Californians, who, according to Mr. Powers, were far less addicted to
polygyny than the Atlantic Indians, are “a humble and a lowly race,
... one of the lowest on earth.”[3204]

Certain peoples who were originally monogamous are known to have
adopted polygyny under the influence of a higher civilization. Thus,
according to Professor Vámbéry, there is not a single indication
that polygyny was an institution of the primitive Turco-Tartars,
and even now it is almost unknown among the nomadic peoples of that
race.[3205] Dr. Mason and Mr. Smeaton state that, among the Karens,
it is occasionally practised only by those who are brought much in
contact with the Burmese.[3206] Among the Hindus, according to Mr.
Dutt, polygyny seems to have grown in the latter part of the Vedic age,
as there are scarcely any allusions to it in the earlier hymns.[3207]
Goguet observes that “fables which can be traced back to the earliest
times give us no instance of any man’s having more than one lawful
wife.”[3208] Although the majority of the heroes in the writings of
Kalidasa are described as polygynists,[3209] the principal divinities
whom the Hindus acknowledge are represented as married to but one
legitimate wife.[3210] The higher position so generally granted to the
_first_ married wife in polygynous families seems to indicate in most
cases a transition from monogamous to polygynous habits, and not _vice
versa_, as has often been suggested.[3211]

Monogamy is the more likely to have prevailed almost exclusively among
our earliest human ancestors, since it does so among the man-like apes.
Mr. Darwin certainly mentions the Gorilla as a polygamist;[3212] but
the majority of statements we have regarding this animal are to the
opposite effect. Relying on the most trustworthy authorities, Professor
Hartmann says, “The Gorilla lives in a society consisting of male and
female and their young of varying ages.”[3213]

We may thus take for granted that civilization up to a certain point is
favourable to polygyny; but it is equally certain that in its higher
forms it leads to monogamy.

One of the chief advantages of civilization is the decrease of
wars. The death-rate of men has consequently become less, and the
considerable disproportion between the sexes which, among many warlike
peoples, makes polygyny almost a law of nature, no longer exists
among the most advanced nations. No superstitious belief keeps the
civilized man apart from his wife during her pregnancy and whilst she
suckles her child; and the suckling time has become much shorter since
the introduction of domesticated animals and the use of milk. To a
cultivated mind youth and beauty are by no means the only attractions
of a woman; and civilization has made female beauty more durable. The
desire for offspring as we have seen, has become less intense. A large
family, instead of being a help in the struggle for existence, is often
considered an insufferable burden. A man’s kinsfolk are not now his
only friends, and his wealth and power do not depend upon the number
of his wives and children. A wife has ceased to be a mere labourer,
and for manual labour we have to a great extent substituted the work
of domesticated animals and the use of implements and machines.[3214]
Polygyny has thus, in many ways, become less desirable for the
civilized man than it was for his barbarian and savage ancestors. And
other causes have co-operated to produce the same result.

When the feelings of women are held in due respect, monogamy will
necessarily be the only recognized form of marriage. In no way does
the progress of mankind show itself more clearly than in the increased
acknowledgment of women’s rights, and the causes which, at lower stages
of development, may make polygyny desired by women themselves, do not
exist in highly civilized societies. The refined feeling of love,
depending chiefly upon mutual sympathy and upon appreciation of mental
qualities, is scarcely compatible with polygynous habits; and the
passion for one has gradually become more absorbing.

Will monogamy be the only recognized form of marriage in the future?
This question has been answered in different ways. According to Mr.
Spencer, “the monogamic form of the sexual relation is manifestly
the ultimate form; and any changes to be anticipated must be in the
direction of completion and extension of it.”[3215] Dr. Le Bon, on the
other hand, thinks that European laws will, in the future, legalize
polygyny;[3216] and M. Letourneau remarks that, although we may now
look upon monogamy as superior to any other form of marriage yet
known, “we need not consider it the Ultima Thule in the evolution of
connubial ceremonies.”[3217] But we may without hesitation assert that,
if mankind advance in the same direction as hitherto; if, consequently,
the causes to which monogamy in the most progressive societies owes
its origin continue to operate with constantly growing force; if,
especially, altruism increases, and the feeling of love becomes more
refined, and more exclusively directed to one,—the laws of monogamy can
never be changed, but must be followed much more strictly than they are
now.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. McLennan suggests that, in early times, polyandry was the rule
and monogamy and polygyny exceptions. According to his view, the
only marriage law in which female kinship could have originated was
polyandry—polyandry of “the ruder sort,” in which the husbands are
not kinsmen. And it is, he says, impossible not to believe that the
Levirate—that is, the practice of marrying a dead brother’s widow—is
derived from polyandry.[3218] The fallacy of the first inference, which
assumes the system of “kinship through females only” to depend upon
uncertainty as to fathers, has already been shown. The second inference
will be found to be equally erroneous.

The Levirate is undoubtedly a wide-spread custom;[3219] and, if it
could be proved to be a survival of polyandry, we should be compelled
to conclude that this form of marriage was at one time very common.
Where women are regarded as property, they are, of course, inherited
like other possessions.[3220] In many cases the brother, or, in
default of a brother, the nearest male relation, is expressly stated
to be _entitled_ to have the widow; and, if he does not marry her, he
has nevertheless, the guardianship over her, and may give her away
or sell her to some other man.[3221] But there are several peoples
who consider the Levirate a duty rather than a right.[3222] Among
the Thlinkets, for example, when a husband dies, his brother or his
sister’s son must marry the widow, and the neglect of this obligation
has occasioned bloody feuds.[3223] The law requiring a man to take care
of a sister-in-law is analogous to other duties devolving on kinsfolk,
such as the vendetta, &c. Mr. McLennan lays stress on the fact that it
is the deceased husband’s _brother_ who inherits his widow. “How came
the right of succession,” he says, “to open, as in the ruder cases,
to the brother in preference to the son of the deceased? We repeat
that the only explanation that can be given of this is, that the law
of succession was derived from polyandry.”[3224] But among many of
the peoples who have the custom of the Levirate, sons either inherit
nothing or are preceded by brothers in succession.[3225] Among the
Santals, for instance, “when the elder brother dies, the next younger
inherits the widow, children, and all the property.”[3226] Among a few
peoples, the widow together with the other property of the dead man
goes either to his brother or to his sister’s son.[3227] But it is
more natural, where succession runs in the female line, that the widow
should be married by the brother than by the nephew, because, as a
rule, she is much older than the nephew, and he, in many cases, is too
young to marry and to maintain her properly.

Even when a son inherits the other property of his father, it is easy
to understand why he does not inherit the widow. To inherit her is,
generally speaking, to marry her. But nowhere is a son allowed to
marry his own mother; hence it is natural, at least where monogamy
prevails, that the right of succession in this case should belong to
the brother. In polygynous families, on the other hand, it often
happens that the eldest son, or all the sons, inherit the father’s
widows, the mother being in each case excepted.[3228] Among the
Bakalai, a tribe in Equatorial Africa, widows are permitted to marry
the son of their deceased husband, and, if there be no son, they may
live with the deceased husband’s brother.[3229] As regards the Negroes
of Benin, Bosman states that, if the mother of the eldest son, the only
heir, be alive, he allows her a proper maintenance, but his father’s
other widows, especially those who have not had children, the son
takes home, if he likes them, and uses as his own; but if the deceased
leaves no children, the brother inherits all his property.[3230] Among
the Mishmis, the heir obtains the wives, with the exception of his
own mother, who goes to the next male relation.[3231] Concerning the
Kafirs of Natal, Mr. Shooter observes that, “when a man dies, those
wives who have not left the kraal remain with the eldest son. If they
wish to marry again, they must go to one of their late husband’s
brothers.”[3232] The rules of succession are thus modified according
to circumstances, and they are not uniform even among the same people.
It frequently happens that the brother succeeds to the chieftainship,
whilst the son inherits the property of the dead man[3233]—no doubt
because the brother, being older and more experienced, is generally
better fitted for command than the son.[3234]

Mr. McLennan calls attention to the fact that, among certain peoples,
the children begotten by the brother are accounted the children of
the brother deceased.[3235] “It is obvious,” he says, “that it
could more easily be feigned that the children belonged to the brother
deceased, if already, at a prior stage, the children of the brotherhood
had been accounted the children of the eldest brother, _i.e._, if we
suppose the obligation to be a relic of polyandry.”[3236] But this
explanation is very far-fetched. As Dr. Starcke justly observes, a
man may, from a juridical point of view, be the father of a child,
though he is not so in fact.[3237] In New Guinea, says M. Bink, “à
la mort du père, c’est l’oncle (frère du père) qui se charge de la
tutelle; si l’enfant devient orphelin, il reconnaît son oncle comme son
père.”[3238] In Samoa, the brother of a deceased husband considered
himself entitled to have his brother’s wife, and to be regarded by
the orphan children as their father.[3239] And, among the Kafirs of
Natal, the children of a deceased man’s widow born in marriage with
his brother, belong to his son.[3240] Quite in accordance with these
facts, the children of a widow may be considered to belong to her
former husband. Indeed, where death without posterity is looked upon as
a horrible calamity, the ownership of the children is a thing of the
utmost importance for the dead man. It is only when the deceased has no
offspring that the Jewish, Hindu, and Malagasy laws prescribe that the
brother shall “raise up seed” to him.

Mr. McLennan has thus failed in his attempt to prove that polyandry has
formed a general stage in the development of marriage institutions; and
we may almost with certainty infer that it has always been exceptional.
We have already pointed out the groundlessness of Mr. McLennan’s
suggestion that in all, or nearly all, the primitive hordes there was
a want of balance between the sexes, the men being in the majority
on account of female infanticide.[3241] Moreover, though polyandry
is due to an excess of men, it would be a mistake to conclude that
an excess of men always causes polyandry. This practice presupposes
an abnormally feeble disposition to jealousy—a peculiarity of all
peoples among whom polyandry occurs. The Eskimo are described as a
race with extraordinarily weak passions.[3242] Among the Sinhalese,
says Dr. Davy, jealousy is not very troublesome among the men, and
the infidelity of a woman is generally easily forgiven.[3243] The
people of Ladakh are a mild, timid, and indolent race.[3244] The Kulu
husbands “sont très peu jaloux.”[3245] The same is said by Mr. Fraser
with regard to the people of Sirmore. The women are “entirely at the
service of such as will pay for their favours, without feeling the
slightest sense of shame or crime in a practice from which they are not
discouraged by early education, example, or even the dread of their
lords, who only require a part of the profit.”[3246] The Tibetans
are represented as very little addicted to jealousy,[3247] being, as
Mr. Wilson remarks, a race of a peculiarly placid and unpassionate
temperament.[3248] But such a lack of jealousy, as we have seen, is a
rare exception in the human race, and utterly unlikely to have been
universal at any time.

Polyandry seems, indeed, to presuppose a certain amount of
civilization. We have no trustworthy account of its occurrence among
the lowest savage races. Mr. Bridges writes that the Yahgans of Tierra
del Fuego consider it utterly abominable. With regard to the Veddahs,
Mr. Bailey states, “Polyandry is unknown among them. The practice
is alluded to with genuine disgust. I asked a Veddah once what the
consequence would be if one of their women were to live with two
husbands, and the unaffected vehemence with which he raised his axe,
and said, ‘A blow would settle it,’ showed conclusively to my mind the
natural repugnance with which they regard the national custom of their
Kandyan neighbours.”[3249] These neighbours are much superior to the
Veddahs in civilization; and the other peoples practising polyandry
have left the lowest stages of development far behind them. The Eskimo
are a rather advanced race, and so are the polyandrous nations of
the Asiatic continent. Speaking of the people of Sirmore, Mr. Fraser
observes, “It is remarkable that a people so degraded in morals, and
many of whose customs are of so revolting a nature, should in other
respects evince a much higher advancement in civilization than we
discover among other nations, whose manners are more engaging, and
whose moral character ranks infinitely higher. Their persons are better
clad and more decent; their approach more polite and unembarrassed;
and their address is better than that of most of the inhabitants of
the remote Highlands of Scotland; ... and their houses, in point of
construction, comfort and internal cleanliness, are beyond comparison
superior to Scottish Highland dwellings.”[3250] On the arrival of the
Spaniards, the polyandrous inhabitants of Lancerote were distinguished
from the other Canarians, who were strictly monogamous, by marks of
greater civilization.[3251]

We have seen that in polyandrous families the husbands are generally
brothers, and that the eldest brother, at least in many cases, has the
superiority, the younger husbands having almost the position, if the
term may be used, of male concubines. It is a fair conclusion that, in
such instances, polyandry was originally an expression of fraternal
benevolence on the part of the eldest brother, who gave his younger
brothers a share in his wife, if, on account of the scarcity of women,
they would otherwise have had to live unmarried. If additional wives
were afterwards acquired, they would naturally be considered the common
property of all the brothers. In this way the group-marriage of the
Toda type seems to have been evolved.




CHAPTER XXIII

THE DURATION OF HUMAN MARRIAGE


The time during which marriage lasts, varies very considerably among
different species. According to Dr. Brehm, most birds pair for
life,[3252] while among the mammals, with the exception of man and
perhaps the anthropomorphous apes, the same male and female scarcely
ever live together longer than a year.[3253] In human marriage every
degree of duration is met with—from unions which, though legally
recognized as marriages, do not endure long enough to deserve to be so
called, to others which are dissolved only by death.

There are a few remarkable instances of peoples among whom separation
is said to be entirely unknown. In the Andaman Islands, according to
Mr. Man, “no incompatibility of temper or other cause is allowed to
dissolve the union.”[3254] The same is said of certain Papuans of New
Guinea,[3255] and of several tribes of the Indian Archipelago who
have remained in their native state, and continue to follow ancient
custom.[3256] The Veddahs of Ceylon have a proverb that “death alone
separates husband and wife;” and Mr. Bailey assures us that they
faithfully act on this principle.[3257]

As a general rule, however, human marriage is not necessarily
contracted for life. The Indians of North America dissolve their
unions as readily as they enter into them. The Wyandots had, it
is said, marriages upon trial, which were binding for a few days
only.[3258] In Greenland, husband and wife sometimes separate after
living together for half a year.[3259] Among the Creeks, “marriage
is considered only as a temporary convenience, not binding on the
parties more than one year,” the consequence being that “a large
portion of the old and middle-aged men, by frequently changing, have
had many different wives, and their children, scattered around the
country, are unknown to them.”[3260] Speaking of the Botocudos, Mr.
Keane remarks that their marriages “are all of a purely temporary
nature, contracted without formalities of any sort, dissolved on the
slightest pretext, or without any pretext, merely through love of
change or caprice.”[3261] In Ruk, it frequently happens that newly
married husbands repudiate their wives;[3262] and, in the Pelew and
Kingsmill Groups, and among the aborigines of Northern Queensland,
divorces are of common occurrence.[3263] “Tasmanian lords,” says Dr.
Milligan, “had no difficulty, and made no scruple, about a succession
of wives.”[3264] Again, in Samoa, “if the marriage had been contracted
merely for the sake of the property and festivities of the occasion,
the wife was not likely to be more than a few days, or weeks, with her
husband.”[3265] In several of the Islands of the Indian Archipelago,
“in the regular marriages the parties are always betrothed to each
other for a longer or shorter time, sometimes not for more than a month
and at others for a period of years.”[3266] Among the Dyaks, there
are few middle-aged men who have not had several wives, and instances
have been known of young women of seventeen or eighteen who had already
lived with three or four husbands.[3267] Among the Yendalines in
Indo-China, it is rare for any woman to arrive at middle age without
having a family by two or more husbands.[3268] The Maldivians, as we
are informed by Mr. Rosset, are so fond of change that many a man
marries and divorces the same woman three or four times in the course
of his life.[3269] Among the Sinhalese, according to Knox, “both men
and women have frequently to marry four or five times before they can
settle down contented;”[3270] and Father Bourien says of the Mantras of
the interior of the Malay Peninsula, that it is not uncommon to meet
individuals who have married even forty or fifty different times.[3271]
Among the Munda Kols, Khasias, Tartars,[3272] and most Mohammedan
peoples,[3273] divorces are very frequent. According to Dr. van der
Berg, an even more fatal influence is exercised on family life in
the East by this laxity of the marriage tie than by polygyny.[3274]
Burckhardt knew Bedouins forty-five years old who had had more than
fifty wives.[3275] A “Sighe” wife in Persia is taken in marriage for
a certain legally stipulated period, which may vary from one hour to
ninety-nine years.[3276] In Cairo, according to Mr. Lane, there are not
many persons who have not divorced one wife, if they have been married
for a long time; and many men in Egypt have in the course of two years
married as many as twenty, thirty, or more wives; whilst there are
women, not far advanced in age, who have been wives to a dozen or
more men successively. Mr. Lane has even heard of men who have been in
the habit of marrying a new wife almost every month.[3277] In Morocco,
Dr. Churcher writes to me, a terrible state of things springs from the
ease with which divorce is obtained; a man repudiates his wife on the
slightest provocation and marries again. “One of the servants here,”
he continues, “is reported to have had nineteen wives already, though
he is still only middle-aged.” Indeed, among the Moors of the Sahara,
according to Mr. Reade, it is considered “low” for a couple to live
too long together, and “the leaders of fashion are those who have
been the oftenest divorced.”[3278] Lobo tells us that, in Abyssinia,
marriage was usually entered upon for a term of years;[3279] and,
among the Somals, separation is exceedingly common.[3280] Many negro
peoples marry upon trial or for a fixed time.[3281] Among the Negroes
of Bondo, a man may so often send away his wife and take a new one that
it is difficult to know who is the father of the children born.[3282]
Regarding the ancient Persians, Professor Rawlinson observes that the
easiness of divorce among the Magians was in accordance with Eranian
notions on the subject of marriage—“notions far less strict than those
which have commonly prevailed among civilized nations.”[3283] Among the
Greeks, especially the Athenians,[3284] and among the Teutons,[3285]
divorce often occurred; and in Rome, at the close of the Republic
and the commencement of the Empire, it prevailed to a frightful
extent.[3286]

Among uncivilized races, as a rule, and among many advanced peoples, a
man may divorce his wife whenever he likes. The Aleuts used to exchange
their wives for food and clothes.[3287] In Tonga, a husband divorces
his wife by simply telling her that she may go.[3288] Among the Hovas
of Madagascar, until the spread of Christianity, marriage was compared
to a knot so lightly tied that it could be undone with the slightest
possible touch.[3289] In Yucatan, a man might divorce his wife for the
merest trifle, even though he had children by her.[3290] Among the
ancient Hebrews,[3291] Greeks,[3292] Romans,[3293] and Germans,[3294]
dislike was considered a sufficient reason for divorce, which was
regarded as merely a private act.

Nevertheless, among a great many peoples, although a husband may
divorce his wife, he does so only under certain exceptional conditions,
marriage, as a rule, being concluded for life.[3295] The Greenlanders
seldom repudiate wives who have had children.[3296] Among the
Californian Wintun, according to Mr. Powers, it is very uncommon for
a man to expel his wife. “In a moment of passion he may strike her
dead, or ... ignominiously slink away with another, but the idea of
divorcing and sending away a wife does not occur to him.”[3297] Among
the Naudowessies, divorce is so rare that Carver had no opportunity
of learning how it is accomplished.[3298] Speaking of several tribes
on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, Harmon remarks that
separation between husband and wife is seldom permanent, the parties,
after a few days’ absence from one another, generally having an
inclination to come together again.[3299] The Iroquois, in ancient
times, regarded separation as discreditable to both man and woman,
hence it was not frequently practised.[3300] If an Uaupé takes a new
wife, the elder one is never turned away, but remains the mistress of
the house.[3301] Among the Charruas and Patagonians, marriage lasts,
as a rule, during the whole of life, if there are children.[3302]
And, concerning the Yahgans, Mr. Bridges writes that there have been
many instances amongst them of husband and wife living together until
separated by death. The same is the case in Lifu, as I am informed
by Mr. Radfield. In Tonga, according to Mariner, more than half of
the number of married women were parted from their husbands only by
death.[3303] Among the Maoris[3304] and the Solomon Islanders,[3305]
and in New Guinea,[3306] divorce is exceptional; and, even in
Tahiti, the birth of children generally prevented the dissolution of
marriage.[3307] In many of the islands of the Indian Archipelago,
divorce may, by law or custom, be readily obtained, but Mr. Crawfurd
says that it is very rarely sued for.[3308] The Garos, according to
Colonel Dalton, “will not hastily make engagements, because, when they
do make them, they intend to keep them.”[3309] Among the Karens, Dr.
Bunker writes, separations, save by death, are rare. Mr. Ingham informs
me that, among the Bakongo, there are plenty of instances of husband
and wife living together till death. Archdeacon Hodgson states the
same regarding the Eastern Central Africans, Mr. Swann regarding the
Waguha, Mr. Eyles regarding the Zulus. Among the Cis-Natalian Kafirs,
according to Mr. Cousins, marriage, in the majority of instances, is
contracted for life.[3310] In the early days of Hebrew history, says
Ewald, it was only in exceptional cases that husbands made an evil use
of the right to divorce a wife.[3311] Among the Greeks of the Homeric
age, divorce seems to have been almost unknown, though it afterwards
became an everyday event in Greece;[3312] and in Rome, in the earliest
times, it was probably very little used.[3313]

Among many peoples custom or law has limited the husband’s power to
dispose of his wife, permitting divorce only under certain conditions.
Thus, among the Kukis, “if a woman has a son by her husband, the
marriage is indissoluble,” though, if they do not agree, and have
no son, the husband can cast off his wife and take another.[3314]
The Red Karens in Indo-China allow divorce if there are no children;
“but should there be one child, the parents are not permitted to
separate.”[3315] In the tribes of Western Victoria, described by Mr.
Dawson, a man can divorce a childless wife for serious misconduct,
but in every case the charge against her must first be laid before
the chiefs of his own and his wife’s tribes, and their consent to
her punishment obtained. If the wife has children, she cannot be
divorced.[3316] Among the Santals and the Tipperahs, divorce can be
effected only with the consent of the husband’s clansmen, or a jury of
village elders.[3317] Several tribes of the Indian Archipelago do not
allow a man to repudiate his wife, except in case of adultery;[3318]
and certain negro peoples have a similar rule, so far as the chief
or first wife is concerned.[3319] Among the Hottentots, according to
Kolben, a man may divorce his wife only “upon showing such cause as
shall be satisfactory to the men of the kraal where they live.”[3320]
Mr. Casalis states that, among the Basutos, “sterility is the
only cause of divorce which is not subject to litigation;”[3321]
and, according to Toda custom, the separation of married couples
does not seem to be lightly tolerated.[3322] Among certain lower
races the consent of the wife appears generally to be necessary for
separation.[3323]

Civilized nations, more commonly than savages, consider marriage a
union which must not be dissolved by the husband except for certain
reasons stipulated by law. Among the Aztecs, it was looked upon as a
tie binding for life, and divorce was always discouraged both by the
magistrates and the community. The husband could repudiate even his
concubines only for just cause and with the sanction of the courts, and
the chief wife only for malevolence, dirtiness, or sterility.[3324]
In Nicaragua, the sole offence for which a wife could be divorced
was adultery.[3325] The Chinese code enumerates seven just causes of
divorce—barrenness, lasciviousness, inattention to parents-in-law,
loquacity, thievishness, ill-temper, and inveterate infirmity,—and
a husband, except for one of these reasons, may not put away his
wife on pain of receiving eighty blows.[3326] But these pretexts for
divorce are very elastic. In one of the old Chinese books we read,
“When a woman has any quality that is not good, it is but just and
reasonable to turn her out of doors.... Among the ancients a wife was
turned away if she allowed the house to be full of smoke, or if she
frightened the dog with her disagreeable noise.”[3327] Nevertheless,
according to Mr. Medhurst, divorce is rare in China.[3328] In Japan
a man might repudiate his wife for the same reasons as in China.
But Professor Rein remarks that the Japanese seldom made use of
this privilege, especially if there were children, as education and
custom required that, in such cases, the wife should be treated with
kindness and consideration.[3329] In Arabia, Mohammed regulated the
law of divorce. “In the absence of serious reasons,” says Ibrâhîm
Halebî, “no Mussulman can justify divorce in the eyes either of
religion or the law. If he abandon his wife or put her away from
simple caprice, he draws down upon himself the divine anger, for ‘the
curse of God,’ said the Prophet, 'rests on him who repudiates his wife
capriciously.’”[3330] Practically, however, a Mohammedan may, whenever
he pleases, without assigning any reason, say to his wife, “Thou art
divorced,” and she must return to her parents or friends.[3331]

According to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ a wife “who drinks spirituous
liquor, is of bad conduct, rebellious, diseased, mischievous, or
wasteful, may at any time be superseded by another wife. A barren
wife may be superseded in the eighth year; one whose children all
die, in the tenth; one who bears only daughters, in the eleventh; but
one who is quarrelsome, without delay.”[3332] At present, in Southern
India, divorce is common among many of the lower castes; but it is
not practised at all among the Brahmans and Kshatriyas, or among the
higher classes of Śudras.[3333] In Rome under the Christian Emperors,
the husband’s right to put away his wife was restricted by imperial
constitutions, which pointed out what were considered just causes of
divorce.[3334] The dogma of the indissoluble nature of marriage, early
vindicated by many Fathers in accordance with the injunction, “What
God hath joined together, let not man put asunder,” came into full
force only by degrees. The Council of Trent definitely suppressed the
last traces of divorce as a legal practice[3335]—a decree which has
exercised a powerful influence on the legislation of Roman Catholic
nations. In Spain, Portugal, and Italy, a husband can demand a judicial
separation, a divorce a _mensâ et thoro_, but the marriage contract
cannot be dissolved; in France divorce was reintroduced by the law of
27th July, 1884. In all Protestant countries divorce is allowed. In
every one of them a man may be divorced from a wife who has committed
adultery, but the other legal grounds on which a divorce, in most
of them, may be obtained, vary in different States. According to
the Prussian ‘Landrecht,’ the list includes, among other causes,
drunkenness and a disorderly life, insanity lasting longer than a
year, and the mutual consent of the husband and wife, if they have no
children;[3336] in Norway and Denmark, mutual consent, if the parties
have been judicially separated for three years previously;[3337] in
Austria, aversion proved to be invincible through several preceding
divorces from bed and board.[3338] The French law recognizes as causes
of divorce, besides adultery, “excès, sévices, injures graves,” as
also “condamnation à une peine afflictive et infamante.”[3339]

Marriage may be dissolved not only by the man but by the woman.
In Madagascar, says Mr. Sibree, although “the power of divorce is
legally in the husband’s hand, a wife can practically divorce herself
in several cases.[3340] The like holds true for many of the lower
races;[3341] whilst, among others, custom or law seems to permit a
wife to separate at least under certain conditions.[3342] Among the
Inland Columbians, according to Mr. Bancroft, “either party may
dissolve the marriage at will.”[3343] If a Bonak wife gets up and
leaves the man, he has no claim ever after on her.[3344] Among the
Navajos, when a woman marries, “she becomes free, and may leave her
husband for sufficient cause.”[3345] Regarding the Guanas, Azara
states, “Le divorce est libre aux deux sexes, comme tout le reste, et
les femmes y sont très-portées.”[3346] In the Sandwich Islands, “a man
and woman live together as long as they please, and may, at any time,
separate, and make choice of other partners.”[3347] In Tahiti, parts
of New Guinea, and in the Marianne Group, the marriage tie may, it is
said, be dissolved whenever either of the parties desires it.[3348]
In some of the smaller islands of the Indian Archipelago, a wife can
sue for divorce if her husband ill-treats her, if he is unfaithful, or
for other reasons.[3349] Among the Shans, “should the husband take
to drinking, or otherwise misconducting himself, the woman has the
right to turn him adrift, and to retain all the goods and money of the
partnership.”[3350] In Burma, if one of the parties is unwilling to
separate, “the other is free to go, provided all property except the
clothes in wear is left behind;” and a wife can demand a divorce for
ill-treatment, or if her husband cannot properly maintain her.[3351]
Among the Irulas of the Neilgherries, the option of remaining in union,
or of separating, rests principally with the woman.[3352] According to
Kandh custom, a wife can return to her father’s house within six months
after the marriage, on the articles which had been paid for her being
restored; and, if childless, she can at any time quit her husband. “In
no case,” says Sir W. W. Hunter, “can the husband forcibly reclaim
her, but a wife separated on any grounds whatsoever from her husband
cannot marry again.”[3353] In Eastern Central Africa, divorce may be
effected if the husband neglects to sew his wife’s clothes, or if the
partners do not please each other.[3354] And, among the Garenganze,
according to Mr. Arnot, a wife “may leave her husband at any time, if
she cares to do so.”[3355]

Passing to more advanced nations, we find that, among the ancient
Mexicans, the wife, as well as the husband, might sue for
separation.[3356] In Guatemala, she could leave him on grounds as
slight as those on which he could leave her.[3357] In China, on the
other hand, a woman cannot obtain legal separation; and the same was
the case in Japan till the year 1873.[3358] According to the Talmudic
Law, the wife is authorized to demand a divorce if the husband refuses
to perform his conjugal duty, if he continues to lead a disorderly
life after marriage, if he proves impotent during ten years, if he
suffers from an insupportable disease, or if he leaves the country
for ever.[3359] According to Mohammedan legislation, divorce may, in
certain cases, take place at the instance of the wife, and, if cruelly
treated or neglected by her husband, she has the right of demanding
a divorce by authority of justice.[3360] The ancient Hindus[3361]
and Teutons[3362] allowed a wife to separate from her husband only
in certain exceptional cases. According to Gallic laws, a wife could
quit her husband without losing her _dos_, “si leprosus sit vir; si
habeat fetidum anhelatum, et si cum ea concumbere non possit.”[3363]
Among the Saxons and Danes in England, marriage might be dissolved
at the pleasure of either party, the wife, however, being obliged to
return the price paid for her, if she deserted the husband without
his consent.[3364] At Athens, a woman could demand a divorce if she
was ill-treated by her husband, in which case she had merely to
announce her wish before the ἄρχων.[3365] Rossbach thinks that, in
Rome, a marriage with _manus_ could be dissolved by the husband only,
a marriage without _manus_ by the wife’s father also.[3366] But Lord
Mackenzie observes that, whatever effect _conventio in manum_ may
have had in ancient times, it did not, in the age of Gaius, limit the
wife’s freedom to seek divorce.[3367] In those Christian States of
Europe where absolute divorce is permitted, the grounds on which it may
be sued for are nearly the same for the man and the woman—except in
England, where the husband must be accused of one or other of several
offences besides adultery. In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, a judicial
separation may always be decreed on the ground of the adultery of the
wife, but, on the ground of the adultery of the husband, only if it has
been committed under certain aggravating circumstances.[3368]

The causes by which duration of human marriage is influenced are, on
the whole, the same as those which determine the form of marriage.

Man’s appetite for youth and beauty often induces him to repudiate
a wife who has grown old and ugly. According to Cook, it was much
more common for a Tahitian to cast off the first wife and take a more
youthful partner than to live with both.[3369] Among the Aleuts, when
a wife “ceases to possess attractions or value in the eyes of her
proprietor, she is sent back to her friends.”[3370] A Malay, in many
cases, turns away his wife as soon as she becomes ugly from hard work
and maternal cares.[3371] In Switzerland, marriage is much oftener
dissolved through divorce when the wife is the husband’s senior, than
when the reverse is the case.[3372]

Dr. Béringer-Féraud observes that the Moors in the region of the
Senegal “divorcent avec une facilité extrême, non seulement sous le
prétexte le plus futile, mais souvent, et même uniquement, pour le
plaisir de changer.”[3373] According to v. Oettingen, the statistics of
divorce and remarriage in Europe prove that the taste for variety is
often the chief cause of the dissolution of marriage.[3374]

As the desire for offspring is a frequent cause of divorce,[3375]
so the birth of children is generally the best guarantee for the
continuance of the marriage tie. Speaking of some Indian tribes of
North America, Schoolcraft says, “The best protection to married
females arises from the ties of children, which, by bringing into play
the strong natural affections of the heart, appeal at once to that
principle in man’s original organization which is the strongest.”[3376]

Where women are regarded almost as beasts of burden, it often happens
that a wife who is a bad worker is divorced. The Dyak husbands “coolly
dismiss their helpmates when too lazy or too weak to work, and select
partners better qualified to undergo the toils of life.”[3377] Among
the Sinhalese, according to Mr. Bailey, sickness is perhaps the
most common reason why a husband repudiates his wife. The heartless
desertion of a sick wife, he says, is “the worst trait in the Kandyan
character, and the cool and unconcerned manner in which they themselves
allude to it, shows that it is as common as it is cruel.”[3378]

However desirable separation, in many cases, may be for the husband,
there are various circumstances which tend to prevent him from
recklessly repudiating his wife. In many instances divorce implies for
the man a loss of fortune. Though not, as a rule,[3379] obliged to
provide the divorced wife with the full means of subsistence, he must,
as already mentioned, usually give her what she brought with her into
the house, and, among several peoples, a certain proportion—often the
half—of the common wealth.[3380] Among the Karens, if a man leaves
his wife, the rule is that the house and all the property belong to
her, nothing being his but what he takes with him.[3381] Among the
Manipuris, according to Colonel Dalton, a wife who is put away without
fault on her part, takes all the personal property of the husband,
except one drinking cup and the cloth round his loins.[3382] Similar
rules prevail among the Galela, and in the Marianne Group.[3383] As
to the ancient Teutons, M. Glasson observes, “Les lois barbares
voulaient d’ailleurs que, sauf le cas d’adultère, la femme répudiée eût
son existence assurée. Le mari devait lui laisser la maison et tout ce
qu’elle contenait; il était même obligé de lui abandonner l’équivalent
du _mundium_ et de payer une amende au fisc s’il répudiait sa femme
sans aucun motif sérieux.”[3384]

The practice of purchasing wives forms a very important obstacle
to frequent repudiation.[3385] If the wife proves barren, or is
unfaithful, or otherwise affords sufficient cause of divorce, the
husband generally receives back what he has paid for her;[3386] but,
if he repudiates her without satisfactory grounds, the purchase sum
is usually forfeited.[3387] “Cases of divorce are very frequent,”
says Mr. Casalis, “where the price of the wife is of small value.
Among the Basutos, where it is of considerable amount, the dissolution
of marriage is attended with much difficulty.”[3388] And Dr. Finsch
ascribes the frequency of divorce in Ponapé to the fact that
wife-purchase does not exist there.[3389]

Moreover, when he divorces his wife, a man very often loses his
children at the same time. Among several peoples they remain the
property of the father.[3390] Among others, they are taken in some
cases by the man, in others by the woman.[3391] In Samoa, the young
children followed the mother, the more advanced the father;[3392]
whilst, among the Sinhalese, boys are taken by the latter, girls by the
former.[3393] But among many uncivilized peoples, all the children,
if young, follow the mother,[3394] as Colden says, “according to the
natural course of all animals.”[3395]

Another factor which has much influence upon the stability of marriage,
is the position held by women. When some regard is paid to their
feelings, a husband does not, of course, put his wife away for trivial
reasons, divorce meaning for her, in many cases, misery and distress.
Dr. Churcher informs me from Morocco that “the divorced woman too
often goes to swell the ranks of the prostitutes.” And the same is the
case in China and among the Arabs of the Sahara.[3396]

When a man and woman unite with one another from love, there is, of
course, more security that the marriage contract will be lasting. The
Mantras, says Father Bourien, “frequently marry without previously
knowing one another, and live together without loving. Is it, then,
astonishing that they part without regret, and that divorce is frequent
among them?”[3397] The facility of Mohammedan divorce, as Mr. Bosworth
Smith remarks, is the necessary consequence of the separation of the
sexes. “A man would never embark in the hazardous lottery of Eastern
marriage, if he had not the escape of divorce from the woman whom he
has never seen, and who may be in every way uncongenial to him.”[3398]
A union with a first cousin, among Mohammedans, is generally lasting,
because early associations may have led to an attachment at a tender
age.[3399] Separation is especially rare when the uniting passion is
not merely of a sensual nature, but involves mutual sympathy depending
upon mental qualities.

Many of the factors which influence the duration of marriage, so far as
it depends upon the will of the husband, operate also in cases where
marriage may be dissolved by the wife. But the woman’s subordinate
position and her inability to support herself, makes separation more
difficult for her than for the man.[3400] Moreover, if the woman claims
a divorce, the purchase-sum paid for her has to be returned,[3401] and
she may even, in certain cases, forfeit her dowry and whatever property
she brought with her at marriage.[3402] If she must lose her children
also, she will naturally shrink from the idea of separation.

Since the causes which influence the duration of marriage are, to
so great an extent, the same as those which influence the form of
marriage, so far as monogamy and polygyny are concerned, we might
expect strict monogamy to be associated with stability of marriage,
and extensive polygyny with instability. But this is only partly the
case. When monogamy is chiefly due to the man’s inability to support
many wives, or when he secures no economical advantage by a plurality
of wives, he tries in many cases to make up for the inconveniences of
monogamy by a frequent change of mate. Mr. Bickmore thinks that the
reason why polygyny is not more generally practised by the Mohammedan
Malays is to be found in the facility with which divorce is obtained
and a new marriage contracted.[3403] And the Arabs of Asia and the
Moors of the Western Sahara, according to Burckhardt and Chavanne,
indemnify themselves through a succession of wives for their monogamous
habits.[3404] Considering, further, that the proportion between the
sexes, and the monogamous instinct which man in early times probably
shared with others of the higher primates, have affected the forms
of human marriage, but scarcely at all its duration, we may infer
that the development of the latter, at least at the lower stages of
civilization, has been somewhat different from that of the former.

As has already been pointed out, it is extremely probable that, among
primitive men, the union of the sexes lasted till after the birth of
the offspring. We have also perhaps some reason to believe that the
connection lasted for years. Lieutenant de Crespigny met Orang-utan
families consisting of male, female, and two young ones, and v.
Koppenfels saw similar groups of the Gorilla; but whether the male
was the father of both the young ones, it is of course impossible to
decide. In any case, there is abundant evidence that marriage has, upon
the whole, become more durable in proportion as the human race has
risen to higher degrees of cultivation, and that a certain amount of
civilization is an essential condition of the formation of life-long
unions.

It is evident that, at the early stage of development at which
women first became valuable as labourers, a wife was united with
her husband by a new bond more lasting than youth and beauty. The
tie was strengthened by the bride-price and the marriage portion.
And greater consideration for women, a higher development of the
paternal feeling, better forethought for the children’s welfare, and
a more refined love-passion have gradually made it stronger, until
it has become, in many cases, almost indissoluble. A husband in the
most advanced societies is no longer permitted to repudiate his wife
whenever he likes; a wife cannot, without more ado, divorce herself
from her husband. Marriage has become a contract the keeping of which
is superintended by the State, and which may be dissolved only under
certain stipulated conditions.

Although there can be no doubt that the psychical causes which have
strengthened the marriage tie tend to become more potent, we must
not conclude that divorce will in future be less frequent and more
restricted by the laws than it is now in European countries. It must
be remembered that the laws of divorce in Christian Europe owe their
origin to an idealistic religious commandment which, interpreted in its
literal sense, gave rise to legal prescriptions far from harmonizing
with the mental and social life of the mass of the people. The powerful
authority of the Roman Church was necessary to enforce the dogma that
marriage is indissoluble. The Reformation introduced somewhat greater
liberty in this respect, and modern legislation has gone further in the
same direction.




CHAPTER XXIV

SUMMARY


Our investigation has now come to an end. The development of human
marriage in all its aspects has been examined, according to the method
suggested in the introductory chapter. Many of the conclusions are more
or less hypothetical, but not a few, I think, are necessary deductions
from trustworthy evidence. As they are based on a great accumulation of
facts, it may be well to present a general view of the argument as a
whole.

We defined marriage as a more or less durable connection between
male and female, lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till
after the birth of the offspring. It is found among many of the lower
animals, it occurs as a rule among the anthropomorphous apes, and it
is universal among mankind. It is closely connected with parental
duties: the immediate care of the children belongs chiefly to the
mother, whilst the father is the protector and guardian of the family.
Being a necessary requirement for the existence of certain species,
it obviously owes its origin to an instinct developed through the
powerful influence of natural selection. If, as seems probable, there
was a human pairing season in early times, the continued excitement of
the sexual instinct cannot have played a part in the origin of human
marriage—assuming that the institution existed among primitive men.
And it is highly probable that it did exist, as the marriage of the
Primates seems to be due to the small number of young and the long
period of infancy. Later on, when mankind became chiefly carnivorous,
the assistance of an adult male became still more necessary for the
subsistence of the children, as the chase everywhere devolves on the
man. The suggestion that, in olden times, the natural guardian of the
children was not the father, but the maternal uncle, has no foundation
in fact; neither has the hypothesis that all the males of the tribe
indiscriminately were their guardians. All the evidence we possess
tends to show that among our earliest human ancestors the family, not
the tribe, formed the nucleus of every social group, and, in many
cases, was itself perhaps the only social group. The man-like apes are
not gregarious, and the solitary life they generally lead is almost
certainly due chiefly to the difficulty they experience in getting
sufficient quantities of food. We may infer that our fruit-eating human
or half-human ancestors were not more gregarious than they. Afterwards,
when man passed beyond his frugivorous stage, he continued, as a rule,
this solitary kind of life, as gregariousness is a disadvantage to all
large animals who live chiefly on flesh. Even now there are savage
peoples of the lowest type who live rather in separate families than in
tribes, and facts indicate that the chief reason for this is want of
sufficient food. The sociability of man, therefore, sprang in the main
from progressive intellectual and material civilization, whilst the tie
that kept together husband and wife, parents and children, was, if not
the only, at least the principal factor in the earliest forms of man’s
social life. Human marriage, in all probability, is an inheritance from
some ape-like progenitor.

Most anthropologists who have written on prehistoric customs believe,
indeed, that man lived originally in a state of promiscuity or
“communal marriage”; but we have found that this hypothesis is
essentially unscientific. The evidence given for it consists of notices
of some savage nations said to live promiscuously, and of some curious
customs which are assumed to be survivals from a time when marriage
did not exist. Many of the assertions made as to peoples living in
promiscuous intercourse have, however, been shown to be erroneous, and
the accuracy of the others is at least open to question. But even if
some of the statements were true, it would be a mistake to infer that
these quite exceptional cases represent a stage of development through
which all mankind have passed; and it is certainly not among the lowest
peoples that sexual relations most nearly approach to promiscuity.
Equally unwarranted is the inference of a primitive condition of
“communal marriage” from the fact that in some parts of the world the
sexes may cohabit freely before marriage. There are numerous savage
and barbarous peoples among whom sexual intercourse out of wedlock is
of rare occurrence, unchastity on the part of the woman being looked
upon as a disgrace or a crime. Contact with a “higher culture” has
proved pernicious to the morality of savage peoples; and we have some
reason to believe that irregular connections between the sexes have, on
the whole, exhibited a tendency to increase along with the progress of
civilization. Moreover, free sexual intercourse previous to marriage
is quite different from promiscuity, which involves a suppression of
individual inclinations. The most general form of it is prostitution,
which is rare among peoples living in a state of nature, untouched
by foreign influence. Customs which have been interpreted as acts of
expiation for individual marriage—a sort of religious prostitution
found in the East; the _jus primae noctis_ granted to the friends of
the bridegroom, or to all the guests at a marriage, or to a particular
person, a chief or a priest; and the practice of lending wives to
visitors—may be far more satisfactorily explained otherwise. This is
true also of the fact that, among certain peoples, courtesans are held
in greater estimation than women married to a single husband. Mr.
Morgan’s view—that the former prevalence of “marriage in a group” and
promiscuity are proved by the “classificatory system of relationship”
in force among many peoples—presupposes that the nomenclature was
founded on blood-relationship, as near as the parentage of individuals
could be known. But it can scarcely be doubted that the terms for
relationships were originally mere terms of address, given chiefly
with reference to sex and age, as also to the external, or social,
relationship in which the speaker stood to the person whom he or she
addressed. It has been suggested that the system of “kinship through
females only”— implying, chiefly, that children are named after their
mothers, not after their fathers, and that property and rank succeed
exclusively in the female line—is due to the uncertain paternity which
resulted from early promiscuity. But the ties of blood have exercised a
far less direct influence on this system than is generally assumed. We
have seen that there may be several reasons for naming children after
the mother rather than after the father, apart from any consideration
of relationship. The custom in accordance with which, among many
peoples, a man, on marrying, goes to live with his wife in the house of
her father deserves special notice in this connection. It is probable
that the causes which make children take their mother’s name have also
directly influenced the rules of succession, but the power of the name
itself seems to have been of even higher importance. Moreover, so
far as we know, there is no general coincidence of what we consider
moral and immoral habits with the prevalence of the male and female
line among existing savages; and among various peoples the male line
prevails, although paternity is often actually uncertain on account of
their polyandrous marriage customs. Avowed recognition of kinship in
the female line only, by no means implies an unconsciousness of male
kinship. Finally, there are many rude peoples who exhibit no traces at
all of a system of “kinship through females only.” Thus the facts put
forward in support of the hypothesis of promiscuity do not entitle us
to assume that promiscuity has ever been the prevailing form of sexual
relations even among a single people, whilst the hypothesis is opposed
to all the correct ideas we are able to form with regard to the early
state of man. Promiscuous intercourse between the sexes tends to a
pathological condition very unfavourable to fecundity; and the almost
universal prevalence of jealousy among peoples unaffected by foreign
influence, as well as among the lower mammals, makes it most unlikely
that promiscuity ever prevailed at any stage of human development. As
we have seen, the idea that a woman belongs exclusively to one man
is so deeply rooted among various peoples that it has led to several
revolting practices.

In the chapter on ‘Marriage and Celibacy’ we noted that the single
state is comparatively rare among savage and barbarous races, who,
as a rule, marry earlier than civilized men. A celibate is, indeed,
looked upon almost as an unnatural being. Very much the same was the
case with the ancient civilized nations both of the Old World and the
New, as is still the case in the East. In modern civilization, on
the other hand, there are several factors—partly economical, partly
psychical—unfavourable to marriage. As a consequence, the proportion of
unmarried people has been gradually increasing in Europe, and the age
at which people marry has risen. A curious kind of celibacy, met with
among various peoples at different stages, is the enforced celibacy of
persons devoted to religion. This evidently depends upon the notion
that sexual intercourse is impure—a notion which seems to have grown
up originally from the instinctive feeling against intercourse between
members of the same family or household.

In the courtship of almost all animal species the male plays the most
active part, and has generally to fight with other males for the
possession of the female. The same was no doubt the case with our early
human ancestors, and this mode of courtship survives even now among
some of the lower races. Much more commonly, however, courtship means
on the part of the man a prolonged making of love; and the woman is far
from being completely passive. We have seen how savage men and women in
various ways endeavour to make themselves attractive to the opposite
sex:—by ornamenting, mutilating, painting, and tattooing themselves.
That these practices essentially subserve this end appears chiefly from
the fact that the time selected for them is the age of puberty. It
seems also probable that clothing, at least in a great many cases, was
originally adopted for a similar reason, and that the feeling of shame,
far from being the original cause of man’s covering his nakedness, is,
on the contrary, a result of this custom.

Whilst the men are generally the courters, the women may in many,
perhaps most, cases accept or refuse their proposals at pleasure.
Though a daughter among the lower races is regarded as an object of
property, and is in many instances betrothed in her earliest youth,
women are not, as a rule, married without having any voice of their
own in the matter. Among existing savages their liberty of selection
is very considerable, and under more primitive conditions—when every
grown-up individual earned his or her own living, when there was,
strictly speaking, no labour, and when a daughter consequently was
neither a slave nor an object of trade—woman was doubtless even more
free in that respect than she is now among most of the lower races.
At a latter stage the case was different. Among peoples who have
reached a relatively high degree of civilization the father’s power,
in connection with a more fully developed system of ancestor-worship,
has invariably become more extensive, more absolute. Not only the
full-grown daughter, but the full-grown son, who among savages enjoys
perfect independence, stands so much in awe of the father that, among
many of these peoples, no marriage is concluded without his consent. We
have given some account of this strengthened paternal authority among
various nations; we have found that it has formed only a transitional
stage in the history of human institutions; and we have indicated the
stages of its gradual decline.

The important subject of sexual selection has necessarily claimed a
good deal of attention. In an introductory chapter we pointed out the
contradiction between Mr. Darwin’s theories of natural and sexual
selection, and endeavoured to show that the sexual selection of the
lower animals is entirely subordinate to the great law of the survival
of the fittest. From the way in which the sexual colours, odours, and
sounds of animals are distributed among different species, we drew the
conclusion that, though they are always to a certain extent hurtful to
the species, they are upon the whole advantageous, inasmuch as they
make it easier for the sexes to find each other; whereas if we accept
Mr. Darwin’s theory, we are compelled to suppose that the inexplicable
æsthetic sense on which his hypothesis is founded, has been developed
in the way most dangerous to the species. We also found that there are
facts incompatible with Mr. Darwin’s explanation of the connection
between love and beauty in mankind, and of the origin of the different
human races. There is an ideal of beauty common to the whole human
race; but this ideal is a mere abstraction, as general similarities
in taste are accompanied by specific differences. Men and women find
beauty in the full development of the visible characteristics belonging
to the human organism in general; of those peculiar to the sex; of
those peculiar to the race. As a certain kind of constitution is best
suited for certain conditions of life, and the racial type is on the
whole that which best harmonizes with the external relations in which
the respective peoples live, we may infer that the full development
of racial characters indicates health, that a deviation from them
indicates disease. Physical beauty is therefore in every respect the
outward manifestation of physical perfection, and the development of
the instinct which prefers beauty to ugliness, healthiness to disease,
is evidently within the power of natural selection. According to Mr.
Darwin, racial differences are due to the different standards of
beauty, whereas, according to the theory indicated in this book, the
different standards of beauty are due to racial differences. We have
seen that the racial peculiarities stand in some connection with the
external circumstances in which the various races live. But, as we
do not know that acquired characters are transmitted from parent to
offspring, it is exceedingly doubtful whether the differences are the
inherited effects of conditions of life to which previous generations
have been subject. It seems most probable that they are due to natural
selection, which has preserved and intensified such congenital
variations as were most in accordance with the conditions under which
the various races lived.

Under the head of the ‘Law of Similarity’ we dealt with the powerful
instinct which, as a rule, keeps animals from pairing with individuals
belonging to another species, and found the origin of this aversion
in the infertility of first crosses and hybrids. No such instinct can
be said to keep the various human races apart from one another; and
it is not known that the diversities even between the races which
least resemble each other are not so great but that, under favourable
conditions, a mixed race may be produced. Closely akin to the horror
of bestiality is the horror of incest, which, almost without exception,
is a characteristic of the races of men, though the degrees within
which intercourse is forbidden vary in an extraordinary degree. It is
nearly universally abominated between parents and children, generally
between brothers and sisters, often between cousins, and, among a
great many peoples uninfluenced by modern civilization, between all
the members of the tribe or clan. We criticized the theories set forth
by various writers as to the origin of such prohibitions. To each of
these theories there are special objections; and all of them presuppose
that men avoid incestuous marriages only because they are taught to
do so. As a matter of fact, the home is kept pure from incestuous
intercourse neither by laws, nor by customs, nor by education, but by
an instinct which under normal circumstances makes sexual love between
the nearest kin a psychical impossibility. Of course there is no innate
aversion to marriage with near relations; but there is an innate
aversion to marriage between persons living very closely together from
early youth, and, as such persons are in most cases related, this
feeling displays itself chiefly as a horror of intercourse between
near kin. The existence of an innate aversion of this kind is proved,
not only by common experience, but by an abundance of ethnographical
facts which show that it is not in the first place by degrees of
consanguinity, but by close living together, that prohibitory laws
against intermarriage are determined. Thus many peoples have a rule of
local exogamy, which is quite independent of kinship. The extent to
which, among various nations, relatives are not allowed to intermarry,
is obviously nearly connected with their close living together. There
is so strong a coincidence (as statistical data prove) between exogamy
and the “classificatory system of relationship”—which system springs,
to a great extent, from the close living together of considerable
numbers of kinsfolk—that they must, in fact, be regarded as two sides
of one institution. Prohibitions of incest are very often more or
less one-sided, applying more extensively either to the kinsfolk on
the father’s side or to those on the mother’s, according as descent
is reckoned through men or women; and we have seen that the line of
descent is intimately connected with local relationships. In a large
number of cases, however, prohibitions of intermarriage are only
indirectly influenced by the close living together. Aversion to the
intermarriage of persons who live in intimate connection with each
other has provoked prohibitions of the intermarriage of relations; and,
as kinship is traced by means of a system of names, the name comes to
be considered identical with relationship. Generally speaking, the
feeling that two persons are intimately connected in some way or other
may, through an association of ideas, give rise to the notion that
intercourse between them is incestuous. There are exceptions to the
rule that close living together inspires an aversion to intermarriage.
But most of the recorded instances of intermarriage of brother and
sister refer to royal families, and are brought about simply by pride
of birth. Incestuous unions may also take place on account of extreme
isolation, and certain instances of such connection are evidently the
results of vitiated instincts. Marriage between a half-brother and a
half-sister, however, is not necessarily contrary to the principle here
laid down, as polygyny breaks up each family into as many sub-families
as there are wives who have children. The question arose:—Why is a
feeling of disgust associated with the idea of marriage between persons
who have lived in a long-continued, intimate relationship from a period
of life at which the action of desire is naturally out of the question?
We found an answer in the evil effects resulting from consanguineous
marriages. It seems to be necessary for the welfare of the species
that the sexual elements which unite shall be somewhat different from,
as it is necessary that they shall be in some way similar to, one
another. The injurious results of self-fertilization among plants and
of close interbreeding among animals appear to prove the existence of
such a law, and it is impossible to believe that it does not apply
to man also. We stated several facts pointing in this direction,
and found reason to believe that consanguineous marriages are much
more injurious in savage regions, where the struggle for existence
is often very severe, than they have proved to be in civilized
society. We also observed that no evidence which can stand the test of
scientific investigation has hitherto been adduced against the view
that consanguineous marriages, in some way or other, are more or less
detrimental to the species. Through natural selection an instinct must
have been developed, powerful enough, as a rule, to prevent injurious
unions. This instinct displays itself simply as an aversion on the part
of individuals to union with others with whom they have lived, but as
these are for the most part blood-relations, the result is the survival
of the fittest.

We proceeded to consider sexual selection as influenced by affection,
sympathy, and calculation. We found that love has only slowly become
the refined feeling it is in the minds of cultivated persons in modern
times, although conjugal affection is far from being unknown, even
among very rude savages. The endogamous rules which prevent different
races, nations, or tribes, hereditary castes, classes, and adherents
of different religions from intermarrying are due to want of sympathy,
and have gradually lost their importance according as altruism and
religious toleration have increased, and civilization has diminished
the barriers which separate different nations and the various classes
of society.

As regards the mode of contracting marriage, we inferred—from the
universality of the horror of incest, and from the difficulty a savage
man has in procuring a wife in a friendly manner without making up
for the loss he inflicts on her father—that marriage by capture must
have been very common at that stage of social development when family
ties had become stronger, and man lived in small groups of nearly
related persons, but when the idea of barter had scarcely presented
itself to his mind. We saw that marriage by capture was succeeded by
marriage by purchase, as barter in general has followed upon robbery.
Again, at a later stage, some feeling of shame was attached to the
idea of selling a daughter, and marriage by purchase was abandoned.
Its gradual disappearance took place in two different ways. On the one
hand, the purchase became a symbol, appearing as a sham sale in the
marriage ceremonies or as an exchange of presents; on the other hand,
the purchase-sum was transformed into the morning gift and the dotal
portion, a part—afterwards the whole—being given to the bride either
directly by the bridegroom or by her father. These transformations
of marriage by purchase have taken place, not only in the history of
the great civilized nations, but among several peoples who are still
in a savage or semi-civilized state. As a rule, however, the marriage
portion plays no important part in savage life, being chiefly due
to a feeling of respect and sympathy for the weaker sex, which, on
the whole, is characteristic of a higher civilization. Very often it
is intended to be a settlement for the wife in case the marriage be
dissolved through the husband’s death or otherwise, although it may
have the meaning of a return gift, or it may imply that the wife as
well as the husband is expected to contribute to the expenses of the
joint household.

Having noted the growth of marriage ceremonies and religious rites,
we passed to the forms of human marriage. Polygyny was permitted by
most of the ancient peoples within the historic period, and is at
present permitted by several civilized nations and by the majority
of savage tribes. Yet, among not a few savage and barbarous races it
is almost unknown, or even prohibited; and almost everywhere it is
confined to the smaller part of the people, the vast majority being
monogamous. Moreover, where polygyny occurs, it is modified, as a
rule, in two ways that tend towards monogamy: through the higher
position granted to one of the wives, generally the first married,
and through the favour constantly shown by the husband to the wife
he likes best. Among certain peoples polyandry occurs, and, like
polygyny, is modified in a monogamous direction, the first husband
usually being the chief husband. Among the causes by which the forms
of marriage are influenced, the numerical proportion between the
sexes plays an important part. In some countries there are more men
than women, in others more women than men. This disproportion is due
to various causes, such as female infanticide, war, and disparity in
the number of the sexes at birth. There are facts which seem to show
that in rough mountainous countries more boys are born than girls,
and that consanguineous marriages produce a considerable excess
of male births. If this be so, it can hardly be a mere coincidence
that polyandry occurs chiefly among mountaineers and peoples who are
endogamous in a very high degree. As for polygyny, there are several
reasons why a man may desire to possess more than one wife. Among
many peoples the husband has to live apart from his wife during her
pregnancy, and as long as she suckles her child. Female youth and
beauty have for men a powerful attraction, and among peoples at the
lower stages of civilization women generally become old much sooner
than in more advanced communities. The liking of men for variety is
also a potent factor; and to have many wives is to have many labourers.
The barrenness of a wife is another very common reason for the choice
of a new partner, as desire for offspring, for various reasons, is
universal in mankind. In a savage and barbarous state a man’s power and
wealth are proportionate to the number of his offspring. Nevertheless,
however desirable polygyny may be from the man’s point of view, it
is prohibited among many peoples, and among most of the others it is
exceptional. Where the amount of female labour is limited, and no
accumulated property exists, it may be very difficult for a man to keep
a plurality of wives. Again, where female labour is of considerable
value, the necessity of paying the purchase-sum for a wife is a
hindrance to polygyny, which can be overcome only by the wealthier
men. Polygyny implies a violation of the feelings of women; hence,
where due respect is paid to these, monogamy is considered the only
proper form of marriage. The refined passion of love, which depends
not only on external attractions, but on sympathy arising from mental
qualities, forms a tie between husband and wife which lasts for life;
and the true monogamous instinct, the absorbing passion for one, is a
powerful obstacle to polygynous habits. It is certain that polygyny
has been less prevalent at the lowest stages of civilization—where
wars do not seriously disturb the proportion of the sexes; where life
is chiefly supported by hunting, and female labour is consequently
of slight value; where there is no accumulation of wealth and no
distinction of class—than it is at somewhat higher stages; and it seems
probable that monogamy prevailed almost exclusively among our earliest
human ancestors. But, though civilization up to a certain point is
favourable to polygyny, its higher forms invariably and necessarily
lead to monogamy. We have noted that polygyny has, in many ways, become
less desirable for the civilized man than it was for his barbarian and
savage ancestors, and that other causes have co-operated to produce
the same result. Again, polyandry, being due to an excess of men and
presupposing an abnormally feeble disposition to jealousy, must at
all times have been exceptional; there is no solid evidence for the
theory that in early times it was the rule. On the contrary, this form
of marriage seems to require a certain degree of civilization. It was
probably, in most cases, an expression of fraternal benevolence on the
part of the eldest brother, and, if additional wives were afterwards
acquired, it led to group marriages of the Toda type.

As a general rule, human marriage is not necessarily contracted for
life, and among most uncivilized and many advanced peoples, a man
may divorce his wife whenever he likes. Nevertheless, divorce is an
exception among a great many races, even among races of the lowest
type; and numerous nations consider, or have considered, marriage a
union which must not be dissolved by the husband, except for certain
reasons stipulated by custom or law. We also noted instances in which
the wife may separate from her husband. The causes by which the
duration of human marriage is influenced are, on the whole, but not
exactly the same as those which determine the form of marriage; and,
though monogamy frequently coexists with great stability of marriage,
this is scarcely the case in the rudest condition of man. Marriage,
generally speaking, has become more durable in proportion as the human
race has advanced.

Marriage has thus been subject to evolution in various ways, though
the course of evolution has not been always the same. The dominant
tendency of this process at its later stages has been the extension of
the wife’s rights. A wife is no longer the husband’s property; and,
according to modern ideas, marriage is, or should be, a contract on
the footing of perfect equality between the sexes. The history of
human marriage is the history of a relation in which women have been
gradually triumphing over the passions, the prejudices, and the selfish
interests of men.
