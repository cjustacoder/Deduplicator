e usufruct of the portion, as long as the union lasts,
it is in many cases impossible to discern whether the original meaning
was that of a return gift to the man or of a settlement for the woman.

We read in the ‘Laws of Manu,’ “What was given before the nuptial
fire, what was given on the bridal procession, what was given in token
of love, and what was received from her brother, mother, or father,
that is called the sixfold property of a woman. Such property, as well
as a gift subsequent and what was given to her by her affectionate
husband, shall go to her offspring, even if she dies in the lifetime of
her husband.”[2491] The Hindu law recognizes the dominion of a married
woman over this property (her “strîdhan”),[2492] but the husband has
nevertheless power to use and consume it in case of distress.[2493]
At Athens, the administration of the dower certainly belonged to the
husband, who might defray with it the expenses of the marriage, and
even had a right to alienate the movable objects forming a part of the
marriage portion.[2494] But it did not become his property. If the
marriage tie was dissolved through divorce or through the husband’s
death, the dower had to be restored to the woman, who, as a security
for this restitution, had a mortgage, consisting generally of a piece
of real property;[2495] or if, in case of divorce, the husband did not
restore the dower, he paid, whilst it was retained, nine oboli every
month as interest.[2496] The Roman _dos_ was intended to be the wife’s
contribution towards the expenses of the marriage state.[2497] It
became the husband’s property, as if it were a patrimony which he had
a right not only to administer, but even to dispose of independently
of the will of his wife.[2498] This confusion of the dower with the
patrimony was tolerable as long as marriage was contracted for life,
but became very disastrous during the period when divorces were
frequent. At the end of the Republican era, therefore, the husband’s
right to dispose of his wife’s marriage portion was limited. It had to
be restored in case of divorce, as also in case of the marriage being
dissolved through the husband’s death. The _Lex Julia de adulteriis_
prevented him from alienating dotal land without the wife’s consent, or
mortgaging it even with her consent; and the legislation of Justinian
prevented alienation with the wife’s consent, and declared the law on
the subject applicable to provincial land.[2499] The general tradition
of the Roman _dos_ was carried on by the Church, the practical object
being to secure for the wife a provision of which the husband could
not wantonly deprive her, and which would remain to her after his
death.[2500] The Roman dotal right, more or less modified in the laws
of the different countries, underlies modern European legislation; the
husband generally administers and has the use of his wife’s dotation,
but it remains _her_ property.[2501]

Among the Germans of early times, the bride-price which was handed
over to the woman as her marriage portion became her exclusive
property, of which the husband could not dispose.[2502] Besides this
_dos_, she received from her parents an endowment, as a sort of
compensation for her inheritance, or as an advance on it. This also
was her private property, at least so far that it went to her if
the marriage was dissolved.[2503] Among the Slavs, the dower seems
originally to have been given to the wife as a security in the event of
her needing independent support; and, among the Poles and Bohemians,
the husband could make no use of it, unless he left his own goods as
a deposit.[2504] In Wales, a woman received not only a part of the
bride-price, “cowyll,” but also a marriage portion from her father,
called “agweddi” (representing the “tincur” of the Irish), which,
during cohabitation, belonged to husband and wife jointly. In case
they separated before the end of seven years, the wife was to receive
this portion back; and in any case, even if she left her husband for
no reason before the seventh year, she had her “cowyll.” If the
separation took place after this period, the property which the wife
brought with her was divided.[2505]

The Hebrews, in early times, generally gave daughters as a dowry only a
part of the “mohar.” Afterwards a woman who married was endowed with
a portion called “nedunia,” of which the husband had the usufruct as
long as the marriage lasted.[2506] The Mohammedans, as a rule, settle
very large dowers on their wives; and it is generally stipulated that
two-thirds of the dowry shall be paid immediately before the marriage
contract is made, whilst the remaining third is held in reserve, to be
paid to the wife in case of her being divorced against her own consent,
or in case of the husband’s death.[2507] And whatever property the
wife receives from her parents or any other person on the occasion of
her marriage, or otherwise, is entirely at her own disposal, and not
subject to any claim of her husband or his creditors.[2508] Speaking
of newly-married people among the Mexicans, Acosta says, “When
they went to house they made an inventory of all the man and wife
brought together, of provisions for the house, of land, of iewells
and ornaments, which inventories every father kept, for if it chanced
they made any devorce (as it was common amongest them when they agree
not), they divided their goods according to the portion that every one
brought.”[2509]

Among races at a lower stage of civilization[2510] the dowry commonly
subserves a similar end—that is, in case of separation or divorce, the
wife gets back her marriage portion, though the husband, as it seems in
most cases, has the usufruct of it as long as marriage lasts. But, in
savage life, the dowry plays no important part. Often nothing of the
kind exists,[2511] and, where it does, the portion generally consists
of some food, clothes, household goods, or other trifles,[2512] and
occasionally of cattle.[2513] Ultimately, as we have seen, the dowry is
due to a feeling of respect and sympathy for the weaker sex, which, on
the whole, is characteristic of a higher civilization.[2514] And, as
we have spoken of a stage of marriage by capture and another stage of
marriage by purchase, we may now speak of a third, where fathers are
bound by law or custom to portion their daughters.

Thus the Hebrews[2515] and Mahommedans[2516] consider it a religious
duty for a man to give a dower to his daughter. In Greece the dowry
came to be thought almost necessary to make the distinction between
a wife and a concubine παλλακή;[2517] and Isaeus says that no decent
man would give his legitimate daughter less than a tenth of his
property.[2518] Indeed, so great were the dowers given that, in
the time of Aristotle, nearly two-fifths of the whole territory of
Sparta were supposed to belong to women.[2519] In Rome, even more
than in Greece, the marriage portion became a mark of distinction
for a legitimate wife.[2520] It was the duty of the wife to
provide her husband with _dos_, and a woman herself had a legal
claim to be provided with a dower by her father or other paternal
ascendants.[2521] And, though later on, Justinian in several of his
constitutions declares that _dos_ is obligatory for persons of high
rank only,[2522] the old custom did not fall into desuetude.[2523] The
Prussian ‘Landrecht’ still prescribes that the father, or eventually
the mother, shall arrange about the wedding and fit up the house of
the newly-married couple.[2524] According to the ‘Code Napoléon,’
on the other hand, parents are not bound to give a dower to their
daughters,[2525] and the same principle is generally adopted by modern
legislation. Yet there is still a strong feeling, especially in the
so-called Latin countries, in favour of dotation. This feeling, as
Sir Henry Maine remarks, is the principal source of those habits of
saving and hoarding, which characterize the French people, and is
probably descended, by a long chain of succession, from the obligatory
provisions of the marriage law of the Emperor Augustus.[2526]

In this course of development, the marriage portion has often become
something quite different from what it was originally. It has in many
cases become a purchase-sum by means of which a father buys a husband
for his daughter, as formerly a man bought a wife from her father.
Euripides, transferring to the heroic age the practice of his own time,
makes Medea complain that her sex had to purchase husbands with great
sums of money.[2527] “Pars minima est ipsa puella sui,” the Latin poet
sings. And, in our days, a woman without a marriage portion, unless she
has some great natural attractions, runs the risk of being a spinster
for ever. This state of things naturally grows up in a society where
monogamy is prescribed by law, where the adult women outnumber the
adult men, where many men never marry, and where married women too
often lead an indolent life.




CHAPTER XIX

MARRIAGE CEREMONIES AND RITES


Among primitive men marriage was, of course, contracted without any
ceremony whatever; and this is still the case with many uncivilized
peoples. Among the Eskimo, visited by Captain Hall, “there is no
wedding ceremony at all, nor are there any rejoicings or festivities.
The parties simply come together, and live in their own tupic or
igloo.”[2528] The Bonaks of California, according to Mr. Johnston,
have no marriage ceremony. The man simply speaks to the girl’s
parents, and to the girl herself; and, if the couple live together for
some time harmoniously, they are considered husband and wife.[2529]
Among the Comanches, too, “there is no marriage ceremony of any
description;”[2530] and the same is said of several other aboriginal
tribes of America,[2531] as also of the Outanatas of New Guinea,[2532]
the Solomon Islanders,[2533] and the Tasmanians.[2534] In Australia,
wedding ceremonies are unknown in most tribes, but it is said that
in some there are a few unimportant ones.[2535] In the Hill Tribes
of North Aracan, marriage “is a simple contract unaccompanied
by ceremony.”[2536] So also among the Khasias,[2537] Chalikata
Mishmis,[2538] Aino,[2539] Negroes of Bondo,[2540] &c.

Marriage ceremonies arose by degrees and in various ways. When the
mode of contracting a marriage altered, the earlier mode, from having
been a reality, survived as a ceremony. Thus, as we have seen, the
custom of capture was transformed into a mere symbol, after purchase
was introduced as the legal form of contracting a marriage. In other
instances the custom of purchase has survived as a ceremony, after it
has ceased to be a reality.

According as marriage was recognized as a matter of some importance,
the entering into it came, like many other significant events in human
life, to be celebrated with certain ceremonies. Very commonly it is
accompanied by a wedding feast. Among the Nufi people, for example,
the nuptials consist of the payment of the bride-price followed
by eating and drinking.[2541] Among the Wanyoro, the wedding is
celebrated by a great deal of feasting, and the bride is taken by a
procession of friends to her new lord.[2542] Often the feast continues
for several days, a week, or even longer.[2543] In Mykonos, of the
Cyclades, according to Mr. Bent, ten or fifteen days of festivity
usually accompany a marriage.[2544] Among some peoples, the expenses
are defrayed by the bridegroom,[2545] in others by the father of the
bride.[2546] Probably, in the former cases, the feast is considered
almost a part of the purchase sum, whilst in the latter it is, perhaps,
occasionally regarded as a compensation for the bride-price.

The marriage ceremony often indicates in some way the new relation
into which the man and woman enter to each other. Sometimes it
symbolizes sexual intercourse,[2547] but far more frequently the living
together, or the wife’s subjection to her husband. Among the Navajos,
the ceremony merely consisted in eating maize pudding from the same
platter;[2548] and among the Santals, says Colonel Dalton, “the social
meal that the boy and girl eat together is the most important part of
the ceremony, as by the act the girl ceases to belong to her father’s
tribe, and becomes a member of her husband’s family.”[2549] Eating
together is, in the Malay Archipelago, the chief and most wide-spread
marriage ceremony.[2550] The same custom occurs among the Hovas,
Hindus, Esthonians, in Ermland in Prussia, and in Sardinia.[2551] Again
in some Brazilian tribes, marriage is contracted by the husband and
wife drinking brandy together.[2552]

In Japan, where the ceremony seems to be regarded as the least
important part of the whole proceeding, it consists in the drinking by
both parties, after a prescribed fashion, of a fixed number of cups of
wine.[2553] In Scandinavia, the couple used to drink the contents of a
single beaker—a custom which also occurs in Russia.[2554] The joining
of hands, or the bridegroom’s taking the bride by the hand, is, as Dr.
Winternitz remarks, one of the most important marriage ceremonies
among all Indo-European peoples.[2555] The same custom occurs among
the Orang-Banûwa of Malacca;[2556] whilst, among the Orang-Sakai,
“the little finger of the right hand of the man is joined to that of
the left hand of the woman.”[2557] At Khasia weddings, “the couple
about to be married merely sit together in one seat, and receive their
friends, to whom they give a dinner or feast.”[2558] Among the Veddahs
of Ceylon, the bride ties a thin cord of her own twisting round the
bridegroom’s waist, and they are then husband and wife. This string is
emblematic of the marriage tie, and, “as he never parts with it, so he
clings to his wife through life.”[2559] The Hindu bride and bridegroom,
again, have their hands bound together with grass.[2560] Among the
Gonds and Korkús, the actual marriage ceremonies consist, in part,
of “eating together, tying the garments together, dancing together
round a pole, being half drowned together by a douche of water, and
the interchange of rings,—all of which may be supposed to symbolize
the union of the parties.”[2561] In many parts of India, bride and
bridegroom are, for the same reason, marked with one another’s
blood,[2562] and Colonel Dalton believes this to be the origin of the
custom, now so common, of marking with red-lead. Thus, the Parkheyas
use a red powder called “sindúr,” the bridegroom sealing the compact
by touching and marking with it the forehead of his bride.[2563]

Among the Australian Narrinyeri, on the other hand, a woman is
supposed to signify her consent to the marriage by carrying fire to
her husband’s hut, and making his fire for him.[2564] The Negroes of
Loango contract their marriages by the bridegroom’s eating from two
dishes, which the bride has cooked for him in his own hut.[2565] In
Dahomey, according to Mr. Forbes, there is no ceremony in marriage,
except where the king confers the wife, “in which instance the maiden
presents her future lord with a glass of rum.”[2566] In Croatia, the
bridegroom boxes the bride’s ears in order to indicate that henceforth
he is her master.[2567] And in ancient Russia, as part of the marriage
ceremony, the father took a new whip, and after striking his daughter
gently with it, told her that he did so for the last time, and then
presented the whip to the bridegroom.[2568]

Many of the ceremonies observed at our own weddings belong to the
classes here noticed. The “best man” seems originally to have been the
chief abettor of the bridegroom in the act of capture; the nuptials are
generally celebrated with a feast in the house of the bride’s father,
and the wedding-ring is a symbol of the close union which exists
between husband and wife.[2569] Even the religious part of the ceremony
has its counterpart among many Pagan nations.

It was natural that a religious character should be given to nuptials,
as well as to other events of importance, by the invoking of divine
help for the future union. In Hudson’s Island, says Turner, “hardly
anything could be done without first making it known to the gods
and begging a blessing, protection, or whatever the case might
require.”[2570] Among the Dyaks, one of the eldest male members of
the assembled party smears at the wedding the hands of the bridegroom
and bride with the blood of a pig and a fowl, implores the protection
of the male spirit, Baak, and the female spirit, Hiroeh Bakak, and
recommends the married couple to their care, wishing them all sorts
of earthly blessings.[2571] Among the Gonds, sacrifice to the gods,
and unlimited gorging and spirit drinking are usually the wind-up of
the wedding.[2572] In Patagonia, the husband, after having brought
the bride into his hut, makes a sacrifice to the foul spirit; and the
Macatecas, a tribe subject to the Mexican empire “fasted, prayed,
and sacrificed to their gods for the space of twenty days after their
marriage.”[2573]

Most commonly a priest is called to perform the religious rite. “The
marriages of the Fijians,” Wilkes says, “are sanctioned by religious
ceremonies.... The Ambati, or priest, takes a seat, having the
bridegroom on his right and the bride on the left hand. He then invokes
the protection of the god or spirit upon the bride, after which he
leads her to the bridegroom, and joins their hands with injunctions to
love, honour, and obey, to be faithful and die with each other.”[2574]
This, however, happens principally among the chiefs; among the common
people, the marriage rites are less ceremonious, the priest of the
tribe only coming to the house and invoking happiness upon the
union.[2575] The Tahitians, too, considered the sanction of the gods
essential to the marriage contract. The preliminaries being adjusted,
the parties repaired to the temple, where the priest addressed the
bridegroom usually in the following terms:—“Will you not cast away
your wife?” to which the bridegroom answered, “No.” Turning to the
bride, he proposed to her a like question, and received a similar
answer. The priest then addressed them both, saying, “Happy will it be
if thus with you two.” He then offered a prayer to the gods on their
behalf, imploring that they might live in affection, and realize the
happiness marriage was designed to secure.[2576] In the Kingsmill
Islands, the priest presses the foreheads of the young couple together,
and pours on their heads a little cocoa-nut oil; then he takes a branch
of a tree, dips it in water, and sprinkles their faces, at the same
time praying for their future happiness and prosperity.[2577] Among the
Kukis, the young couple are led before the Thémpoo, or priest, “who
presents them with a stoup of liquor out of which they both drink,
while he continues muttering some words in his unknown language;”[2578]
and, among the Khyoungtha[2579] and Garos,[2580] a priest beseeches the
gods to bless the union. Among the Igorrotes of Luzon it is a priestess
that performs the marriage ceremony, praying to the spirits of the
deceased in the presence of all the kinsfolk of the couple.[2581] The
Jakuts require the shaman’s assistance for their nuptials,[2582] and so
did formerly the Kalmucks.[2583]

The religious ceremonies connected with marriage are not limited to
prayers, sacrifices, and other means of pleasing the gods; efforts are
also made to ascertain their will beforehand. In Siam, the parents of
the parties solicit the opinion of some fortune-teller on the point
whether the year, month, and day of the week when the couple were born,
will allow of their living happily together as husband and wife.[2584]
Among the Chukmas, “omens are carefully observed, and many a promising
match has been put a stop to by unfavourable auguries.”[2585] The same
is the case with other peoples of India,[2586] the Mongols,[2587]
some Turkish nations,[2588] &c. In several countries it is considered
a thing of the utmost importance to find out the right day for the
wedding, by consulting the stars or otherwise.[2589]

Among civilized nations marriage is almost universally contracted
with religious ceremonies either with or without the assistance of a
priest. The ancient Mexicans were married by their priests,[2590] and
so were the Chibchas[2591] and Mayas.[2592] In Nicaragua, the priest,
in performing the ceremony of marriage, took the parties by the little
finger, and led them to a fire which was kindled for the occasion. He
instructed them in their duty, and, when the fire became extinguished,
the parties were looked upon as husband and wife.[2593]

By Buddhist monks marriage is regarded only as a concession to human
frailty, and, in Buddhistic countries, it is therefore a simple civil
contract;[2594] nevertheless, it is commonly contracted with some
religious ceremony, and often with the assistance of a lama.[2595] In
China, the bridal pair are conducted to the ancestral hall, where they
prostrate themselves before the altar, on which the ancestral tablets
are arranged.[2596] Among the Hebrews, marriage was no religious
contract, and there is no trace of a priestly consecration of it either
in the Scriptures or in the Talmud. Yet, according to Ewald, it may
be taken for granted that a consecration took place on the day of
betrothal or wedding, though the particulars have not been preserved in
any ancient description.[2597] Among the Mohammedans also, marriage,
though a mere civil contract, is concluded with a prayer to Allah.[2598]

“Les lois des peuples de l’antiquité,” M. Glasson says, “avaient un
caractère à la fois religieux et civil; il n’est donc pas étonnant
qu’elles aient le plus souvent fait du mariage un acte à la fois
religieux et civil.”[2599] In Egypt, at least during the Ptolemaic
period, the wedding is supposed to have been accompanied by a religious
ceremony.[2600] Among the ancient Persians, the betrothal was performed
by a priest, who joined the hands of the couple whilst reading some
prayers.[2601] The Hindus used by prayers and sacrifices to invoke
the help of the gods at their weddings.[2602] According to Sir W. H.
Macnaghten, marriage is among them “not merely a civil contract, but a
sacrament, forming the last of the ceremonies prescribed to the three
regenerate classes, and the only one for Śudras; and an unmarried
man has been declared to be incapacitated from the performance of
religious duties.”[2603] In Greece, marriages were generally, though
not always, contracted at the divine altars and confirmed by oaths,
the assistance of a priest, however, not being requisite. Before the
marriage was solemnized, the gods were consulted and their assistance
implored by prayers and sacrifices, which were usually offered to
some of the deities that superintended the union of the sexes, by the
parents or other relations of the persons to be married. For marriage,
as Musonius says, “stands under the protection of great and powerful
gods;” and Plato teaches us that a man shall cohabit only with a woman
who has come into his house with holy ceremonies.[2604] From the
Homeric age we have no instances of marriages being contracted with
sacrifices and religious rites, but we must not therefore take for
granted that they were entirely wanting.[2605] The Teutons, according
to Weinhold, looked upon marriage as an important and holy undertaking,
about which it was necessary that the gods should be consulted; and
offerings were probably in use among all peoples of this branch of the
Aryan race.[2606] The Romans, at their nuptials, made a sacrifice,
named _libum farreum_, to the gods, and the couple were united with
prayer.[2607] In the mode of marriage called _confarreatio_, the
Pontifex Maximus seems to have instructed them in the formulas, and
some modern authorities even believe that he performed the marriage
ceremony. But Rossbach thinks that this was scarcely the case in early
times, when every house-father himself was a priest.[2608] Besides
sacrifices and prayers, auspices formed a very important part of a
Roman wedding; and, if the gods were found to be opposed to the match,
the nuptials were put off or the match was abandoned. Even Cicero
considered it wicked to marry without auspices.[2609]

It has been suggested that, among primitive Aryans, religious
ceremonies were requisite for the validity of marriage.[2610] This was
certainly not the case in historical times either among the Greeks
or among the Teutons; and at Rome such ceremonies were obligatory
only in _confarreatio_.[2611] But this form of marriage peculiar
to the patricians, derived its origin from a very early period,
and Rossbach remarks that the farther back we go in antiquity, the
more strictly we find the religious ceremonies attended to.[2612]
In _confarreatio_ they were essential even in the eye of the law,
whilst in _coemptio_ and _usus_ sacrifices and auspices were merely
of secondary importance.[2613] Later on, when indifference to the old
faith increased, they became more and more uncommon, till at the end of
the period of the Pagan Emperors, they were almost exceptional, being
regarded as a matter of no significance.[2614]

Christianity gave back to marriage its religious character. The
founder of the Christian Church had not prescribed any ceremonies
in connection with it, but in the earliest times the Christians, of
their own accord, asked for their pastors’ benediction. This was not,
indeed, a necessity, and for widows sacerdotal nuptials were not
even allowed.[2615] Yet from St. Paul’s words, “Τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο
μέγα ἐστίν”[2616]—in the Vulgate translated, “Sacramentum hoc magnum
est,”—the dogma that marriage is a sacrament was gradually developed.
Though this dogma was fully recognized in the twelfth century,[2617]
marriage was, nevertheless, considered valid without ecclesiastical
benediction till the year 1563, when the Council of Trent made it an
essentially religious ceremony.

Luther’s opinion that all matrimonial affairs belong not to the
Church, but to the jurists, was not accepted by the legislators of the
Protestant countries. Marriage certainly ceased to be thought of as a
sacrament, but continued to be regarded by the Protestants as a Divine
institution; hence sacerdotal nuptials remained as indispensable as
ever.

It was the French Revolution that first gave rise to an alteration in
this respect. The constitution of the 3rd September, 1791, declares
in its seventh article, title ii., “La loi ne considère le mariage
que comme contrat civil. Le pouvoir législatif établira pour tous
les habitants, sans distinction, le mode par lequel les naissances,
mariages et décès seront constatés et il désignera les officiers
publics qui en recevront les actes.”[2618] To this obligatory civil act
a sacerdotal benediction may be added, if the parties think proper.

Since then civil marriage has gradually obtained a footing in the
legislation of most European countries, in proportion as liberty of
conscience has been recognized. The French system has lately been
adopted in Germany and Switzerland; whilst other nations have been
less radical. “Tantôt,” says M. Glasson, “on a le choix entre le
mariage civil ou le mariage religieux, en ce sens que l’union bénie à
l’église vaut en même temps, d’après la loi, comme mariage civil: c’est
ce qui a lieu en Angleterre et en Espagne. Tantôt le mariage religieux
est une condition de la validité du mariage civil, comme en Roumanie.
En Italie, on peut indifféremment célébrer l’une ou l’autre des deux
unions la première. Enfin, il y a des pays où le mariage civil joue
un rôle purement secondaire: en Autriche, en Portugal, en Suède, en
Norwége, il est subsidiaire; en Russie il n’a été établi que pour les
sectaires.”[2619]

Civil marriage, implying the necessity of the union being sanctioned
by secular authority, is not a merely European institution. Among the
ancient Peruvians, the king convoked annually, or every two years, at
Cuzco all the marriageable young men and maidens of his family. After
calling them by name, he joined their hands, and delivered them to
their parents. Such marriages among that class were alone denominated
lawful; and the governors and chiefs were, by their offices, obliged
to marry, after the same formalities, the young men and women of the
provinces over which they presided.[2620] In Nicaragua also, marriage
was “a civil rite, performed by the cacique.”[2621] And among the
savage Pomo of California, who have two chiefs, a “war-chief” and a
“peace-chief,” the latter, as being a kind of _censor morum_, has to
perform the marriage ceremonies, so far as they extend, _i.e._, he
causes the parties to enter into a simple covenant in presence of their
parents and friends.[2622] Again, among certain tribes no marriage
is permitted without the chief’s approval. But such cases seem to be
exceptions among non-European peoples, especially those of a lower
culture, marriage being generally considered a private matter, with
which the authorities or the community have nothing to do, if only it
takes place between persons who, by law or custom, are permitted to
intermarry.

In this chapter reference has often been made to the validity of
marriage. A lawful marriage is, indeed, quite a different thing from
a marriage in the natural history sense of the term. The former,
which is contracted under the formalities and in accordance with
the stipulations prescribed by the written or unwritten laws of the
country, implies the recognition by society both of the validity of the
union and the legitimacy of the children. Every people is not so happy
as the Nukahivans, among whom, according to Lisiansky, no such thing as
illegitimacy is known.[2623] The Greeks regarded a union into which the
woman entered without dowry as concubinage, rather than as marriage.
Among other peoples purchase is the only way of contracting a valid
marriage. So it was with the ancient Germans and Scandinavians.[2624]
So it is with the Californian Karok, among whom the children of a
woman who is not purchased are accounted no better than bastards and
constitute a class of social outcasts who can intermarry only among
themselves.[2625] Often certain ceremonies are required for a marriage
to be legal. Thus the Romans considered an alliance made without
_sponsalia_, _nuptiæ_, and _dos_, concubinage.[2626] Among the Nez
Percés in Oregon, the consent of the parents is all that is necessary
for a marriage to be valid; sometimes, when the parents refuse their
consent, a run-away match occurs, “but it is not regarded as a legal
marriage, and the woman thereafter is considered a prostitute, and is
treated accordingly.”[2627]




CHAPTER XX

THE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE


Most of the lower animal species are by instinct either monogamous or
polygynous. With man, every possible form of marriage occurs. There are
marriages of one man with one woman (monogamy), of one man with many
women (polygyny), of many men with one woman (polyandry), and, in a few
exceptional cases, of many men with many women.

Polygyny was permitted by most of the ancient peoples with whom history
acquaints us, and is, in our day, permitted by several civilized
nations and the bulk of savage tribes.

The ancient Chibchas practised polygyny to a large extent.[2628] Among
the Mexicans[2629] and the Peruvian Incas,[2630] a married man might
have, besides his legitimate wife, less legitimate wives or concubines.
The same is the case in China and Japan, where the children of a
concubine have the same legal rights as the children of a wife.[2631]
In Corea, the mandarins are even bound by custom, besides having
several wives, to retain several concubines in their “yamen.”[2632]

Tradition shows polygyny and concubinage to have been customary among
the Hebrews during the patriarchal age. Esau married Judith and
Basemath, Jacob married Leah and Rachel.[2633] Later on, we read of
Solomon, who had “seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines;”[2634] and of Rehoboam, who “took eighteen wives and
threescore concubines.”[2635] Indeed, polygyny was so much a matter of
course that the law did not even criticize it.[2636] According to the
Talmudic right also, it was permitted, though the number of legitimate
wives was restricted to four.[2637] Among European Jews, it was still
practised during the Middle Ages, and, among Jews living in Mohammedan
countries, it occurs even to this day.[2638] The Korân allows a man to
take four legitimate wives,[2639] and he may take as many concubines as
he likes. Between a wife and a concubine the difference is, indeed, not
great: the former has her father as her protector, whilst the latter is
defenceless against the husband.[2640] A slave, on the other hand, is
not permitted to have more than two wives at the same time.[2641]

Diodorus Siculus informs us that the Egyptians were not restricted to
any number of wives, but that everyone married as many as he chose,
with the exception of the priesthood, who were by law confined to
one consort.[2642] The Egyptians had concubines also, most of whom
appear to have been foreign women—war-captives or slaves; and these
were members of the family, ranking next to the wives and children
of their lord, and probably enjoying a share of the property after
his death.[2643] With regard to the Assyrians, Professor Rawlinson
states that, so far as we have any real evidence, their kings appear
as monogamists; but he thinks it is probable that they had a certain
number of concubines.[2644] In Media, on the other hand, polygyny
was commonly practised among the more wealthy classes;[2645] and the
Persian kings, particularly in later times, had a considerable number
of wives and concubines.[2646]

None of the Hindu law-books restricts the number of wives whom a man is
permitted to marry.[2647] We find undoubted cases of polygyny in the
hymns of the ‘Rig-Veda,’[2648] and several passages in the ‘Laws of
Manu’ provide for a plurality of wives without any restriction.[2649]
Speaking of the modern Hindus, Mr. Balfour says, “By the law a Hindu
may marry as many wives, and by custom keep as many concubines, as he
may choose.”[2650]

The Greeks of the Homeric age frequently had concubines, who lived
in the same house as the man’s family, and were regarded half as
wives.[2651] Polygyny, in the fullest sense of the term, appears to be
ascribed to Priam, but to no one else.[2652] At a later period a kind
of concubinage seems to have been recognized in Greece by law, and
scarcely proscribed by public opinion;[2653] and bigamy was practised
by the tyrants in some of the Greek colonies.[2654] The Romans were
more strictly monogamous. Among them, concubinage was always well
distinguished from legal marriage, and, according to Rossbach, was much
less common in early times than subsequently.[2655]

Among the Teutons, at the beginning of their history, we come across
plurality of wives in the West,[2656] and especially in the North.
The Scandinavian kings indulged in polygyny,[2657] and it does not
seem to have been restricted to them only.[2658] Nor was it unknown to
the pagan Russians.[2659] In the Finnish poems, though polygyny is not
mentioned, there are passages which seem to indicate that it was not
entirely unheard of among the Finns of early times.[2660]

Even in the Christian world open polygyny has occasionally been
permitted, or at least tolerated. It was frequently practised by the
Merovingian kings, and one law of Charles the Great seems to imply
that it was not unknown even among priests.[2661] Soon after the Peace
of Westphalia, bigamy was allowed in some German States where the
population had been largely reduced during the Thirty Years’ War. And
in modern Europe polygyny, as Mr. Spencer remarks, long survived in the
custom which permitted princes to have many mistresses; “polygyny in
this qualified form remaining a tolerated privilege of royalty down to
late times.”[2662] Moreover, St. Augustin said expressly that he did
not condemn polygyny;[2663] and Luther allowed Philip the Magnanimous
of Hessen, for political reasons, to marry two women. Indeed, he openly
declared that, as Christ is silent about polygyny, he could not forbid
the taking of more than one wife.[2664] The Mormons, as all the world
knows, regard polygyny as a divine institution.

Among many savage peoples polygyny is developed to an extraordinary
extent. In Unyoro, according to Emin Pasha, it would be absolutely
improper for even a small chief to have fewer than ten or fifteen
wives, and poor men have three or four each.[2665] Serpa Pinto tells
us of a minister in the Barôze, who at the time of his visit to that
country had more than seventy wives.[2666] In Fiji, the chiefs had from
twenty to a hundred wives;[2667] and, among all of the North American
tribes visited by Mr. Catlin, “it is no uncommon thing to find a chief
with six, eight, or ten, and some with twelve or fourteen wives in
his lodge.”[2668] The King of Loango is said to have seven thousand
wives.[2669]

It is a more noteworthy fact that among not a few uncivilized peoples,
polygyny is almost unknown, or even prohibited. The Wyandots, according
to Heriot, restricted themselves to one wife;[2670] and, among the
Iroquois, polygyny was not permitted, nor did it ever become a
practice.[2671] It is said that, among the Californian Kinkla and
Yurok, no man has more than one wife.[2672] The Karok do not allow
bigamy even to the chief; and, though a man may own as many women
for slaves as he can purchase, he brings obloquy upon himself if he
cohabits with more than one.[2673] Nor does polygyny occur among the
Simas, the Coco-Maricopas, and several other tribes on the banks of
the Gila and the Colorado;[2674] nor among the Moquis in New Mexico,
and certain nations who inhabit the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.[2675] And,
in several tribes of South America, the men are stated to have but one
wife.[2676]

The Guanches of the Canary Islands, except the inhabitants of
Lancerote, lived in monogamy;[2677] and the same is the case with the
Quissama tribe in Angola, the Touaregs, and the Beni-Mzab.[2678] Among
all the Moorish tribes in the Western Sahara, Vincent did not meet a
single man who had a plurality of wives.[2679]

In Asia we find many instances of strictly monogamous peoples. The
Veddahs in Ceylon are so rigorous in this respect that infidelity
never seems to occur among them.[2680] In the Andaman Islands,
according to Mr. E. H. Man, “bigamy, polygamy, polyandry, and divorce
are unknown;”[2681] and the Nicobar Islanders—at least those on the
most northern island, Car Nicobar—“have but one wife, and look upon
unchastity as a very deadly sin.”[2682] Among the Koch and Old Kukis,
polygyny and concubinage are forbidden;[2683] whilst, among the Pádams,
Mikris, and Munda Kols, a man, though not expressly forbidden to have
many wives, is blamed if he has more than one.[2684] The Badagas of
the Neilgherry Hills, the Nagas of Upper Assam, the Kisáns, and Meches
confine themselves to one consort at the same time;[2685] and so do
the Mrús and Toungtha, who do not consider it right for a master to
take advantage of his position even with regard to the female slaves
in his house.[2686] Among the Santals, says Mr. E. G. Man, a woman
reigns alone in her husband’s wigwam, “as there is seldom, if ever, a
second wife or concubine to divide his affections—polygamy, although
not exactly prohibited, being not very popular with the tribe.”[2687]
Among the Karens of Burma,[2688] and certain tribes of Indo-China, the
Malay Peninsula, and the Indian Archipelago, polygyny is said either
to be forbidden[2689] or unknown.[2690] The Igorrotes of Luzon are
so strictly monogamous, that, in case of adultery, the guilty party
can be compelled to leave the hut and the family for ever.[2691] The
Hill Dyaks marry but one wife, and a chief who once broke through this
custom lost all his influence; adultery is entirely unknown among
them.[2692] The Alfura of Minahassa were formerly monogamists, and the
occasional occurrence of polygyny in later times, according to Dr.
Hickson, was a degeneration from the old customs, brought about perhaps
by Mohammedan influence.[2693]

In Santa Christina or Tauata (Marquesas Islands), monogamy is said
to be the exclusive form of marriage.[2694] Among the Papuans of
Dorey, not only is polygyny forbidden, but concubinage and adultery
are unknown.[2695] In Australia, Mr. Curr has discovered some truly
monogamous tribes. In the Eucla tribe, “none of the men have more than
one wife;”[2696] among the Karawalla and Tunberri tribes, dwelling on
the Lower Diamantina, polygyny is not allowed;[2697] and in the Birria
tribe, “the possession of more than one wife is absolutely forbidden,
or was so before the coming of the whites.”[2698]

In certain American tribes the chiefs alone are permitted to have a
plurality of wives.[2699] A similar exclusive privilege seems to have
been granted to the nobility in ancient Peru.[2700] Among the Ainos
of Yessy, according to v. Siebold only the chief of the village, and,
in some places, the wealthier men are allowed to have more than one
wife.[2701]

Even where polygyny is permitted by custom or law, it is by no means
so generally practised as is often supposed. Almost everywhere it is
confined to the smaller part of the people, the vast majority being
monogamous. We are told that, in the New Hebrides, “all the men are
polygamists, generally having three or four wives apiece;”[2702] that
among certain Kafir tribes, “the average number of wives to each
married man amongst the common people is about three;”[2703] that,
among the Masai, a poor man has generally two wives.[2704] But there
is sufficient evidence that such peoples form exceptions to an almost
universal rule.

In a ‘Sociological Study’ on the Lower Congo, Mr. Phillips remarks,
“It is a mistaken opinion that in a polygamous society most men
have more than one wife: the relative numbers of the sexes forbid
the arrangement being extended to the whole population; really only
the wealthier can indulge in a plurality of wives, the poorer having
to be content with one or often with none.”[2705] Proyart says the
same of the people of Loango, adding that the rich, who can use the
privilege of having many wives, are far from being numerous;[2706]
and like statements are made with reference to several other negro
peoples.[2707] Among many Kafir tribes,[2708] the Bechuanas,[2709]
Hottentots,[2710] and Eastern Central Africans,[2711] monogamy is the
rule; whilst, amongst the Touaregs,[2712] Tedâ,[2713] Marea,[2714]
Beni-Amer,[2715] &c.,[2716] polygyny is expressly stated to be confined
to a few men only. “La plupart des Kabyles,” say Messrs. Honateau and
Letournex, “n’ont ... qu’une femme;”[2717] and in Egypt, according to
Mr. Lane, not more than one husband in twenty has two wives.[2718] We
may, indeed, say with Munzinger[2719] that even in Africa, the chief
centre of polygynous habits, polygyny is an exception.

It is so among all Mohammedan peoples, in Asia and Europe, as well
as in Africa.[2720] “In India,” says Syed Amír’ Alí, “more than
ninety-five per cent. of Mohammedans are at the present moment,
either by conviction or necessity, monogamists. Among the educated
classes versed in the history of their ancestors, and able to compare
it with the records of other nations, the custom is regarded with
disapprobation amounting almost to disgust. In Persia, according to
Colonel Macgregor’s statement, only two per cent. of the population
enjoy the questionable luxury of a plurality of wives.[2721] Moreover,
although polygyny is sanctioned by custom among the Cochin Chinese,
the Siamese, the Hindus, and many other races of India, the mass of
these peoples are in practice monogamous.[2722] In China, among the
labouring classes, it is rare to find more than one woman to one man,
and Dr. Gray thinks that, in the earliest ages, concubinage was a
privilege of the wealthy classes only.[2723] Among the peoples of
Central and Northern Asia and, generally, among all the uncivilized or
semi-civilized peoples belonging to the Russian Empire, polygyny is,
or, before the introduction of Christianity, was, an exception.[2724]

In the Indian Archipelago, says Mr. Crawfurd, polygyny and concubinage
exist only among a few of the higher ranks, and may be looked upon
as a kind of vicious luxury of the great, for it would be absurd to
regard either one or the other as an institution affecting the whole
mass of society.[2725] The truth of this assertion is fully confirmed
by Raffles, as regards the Javanese; by Low and Boyle, as regards
the Malays of Sarawak; by Marsden, Wilken, and Forbes as regards the
Sumatrans; by Schadenberg, as regards the Aëtas of the Philippines; and
so on.[2726]

In various parts of the Australian continent monogamy is said to be the
rule.[2727] In the Larrakía tribe (Port Darwin), for instance, only
about ten per cent. of those who are married have two wives.[2728] In
Tasmania, polygyny, if not unknown, was quite exceptional.[2729] Among
the Maoris, according to Dieffenbach, it is “very uncommon.”[2730] In
the Sandwich Islands, it was practised only by the chiefs, whose means
enabled them to maintain a plurality of wives.[2731] Indeed, in almost
every group of the Pacific Islands polygyny is expressly stated to be
an exception.[2732]

The same is the case with the American aborigines.[2733] Dalager states
that, on the west coast of Greenland, in his time, hardly one man in
twenty had two wives, and it was still more uncommon for one man to
have three or four.[2734] Among the Thlinkets, as a rule, a man had but
one wife.[2735] The aborigines of Hispaniola, with the exception of
the king or chief, seemed to Columbus to live in monogamy.[2736] And
Mr. Bridges writes that, in Tierra del Fuego, polygyny is practised
“in some districts very rarely, in others more frequently, but in no
part generally.”

All the statements we have from the ancient world seem to indicate that
polygyny was an exception. Speaking of the Hebrews, Dr. Scheppig says
that, although our information about the marital affairs of common
Hebrews is too scanty to entitle us to conclude, from the scarcity of
cases of polygyny recorded, that such cases were actually rare, we may
assume that keeping up several establishments was too expensive for any
but the rich.[2737] In Egypt, as we may infer from the numerous ancient
paintings illustrative of domestic life in that country, polygyny
was of rare occurrence; and Herodotus expressly affirms that it was
customary for the Egyptians to marry only one wife.”[2738] Spiegel
thinks that the ancient Persians were as a rule monogamous,[2739]
and Sir Henry Maine and Dr. Schrader make a similar suggestion as to
the early Indo-Europeans in general.[2740] Among the West Germans,
according to Tacitus, only a few persons of noble birth had a plurality
of wives;[2741] and, in India, polygyny as a rule was confined to kings
and wealthy lords.[2742] In a hymn of the ‘Rig-Veda,’ which dwells
upon the duality of the two Aświns, the pairs of deities are compared
with pairs of almost everything that runs in couples, including a
husband and wife, and two lips uttering sweet sounds.[2743]

Where polygyny occurs, it is modified, as a rule, in ways that tend
towards monogamy: first, through the higher position granted to one
of the wives, generally the first married; secondly, through the
preference given by the husband to his favourite wife as regards sexual
intercourse.

Among the Greenlanders,[2744] Thlinkets,[2745] Kaniagmuts,[2746]
Crees,[2747] and probably most of the North American tribes who
practise polygyny,[2748] the first married wife is the mistress of
the house. The Aleuts distinguish the first or real wife from the
subsequent wives by a special name.[2749] Among the Ahts, the children
of a chief’s extra wives have not the father’s rank.[2750] The
Algonquins, says Heriot, permit two wives to one husband, but “the
one is considered of a rank superior to the other, and her children
alone are accounted legitimate.”[2751] Among the Mexicans,[2752]
Mayas,[2753] Chibchas,[2754] and Peruvians,[2755] the first wife took
precedence of the subsequent wives, or, strictly speaking, they had
only one “true and lawful wife,” though as many concubines as they
liked. In Nicaragua, bigamy, in the juridical sense of the term,
was punished by exile and confiscation of property;[2756] and, in
Mexico, neither the wives of “second rank” nor their children could
inherit property.[2757] Among the Mosquitoes, Tamanacs, Uaupés,
Mundrucûs,[2758] and other South American peoples,[2759] the first
wife generally has superiority in domestic affairs. Among the Brazilian
aborigines, however, no difference in rights exist between the children
of different wives.[2760]

The first wife is superior in authority to the others among the
Western Victorians, Narrinyeri, Maoris,[2761] &c.[2762] In Samoa, a
chief had, besides his wife, one, two, or three concubines;[2763] and
in Tahiti, according to Ellis, it was rather a system of concubinage
than a plurality of wives, that prevailed among the higher chiefs, the
woman to whom the chief was first united in marriage, or whose rank
was nearest his own, being generally considered his wife in the proper
sense of the term, while the others held an inferior position.[2764]

In the Indian Archipelago, according to Mr. Crawfurd, the wife of the
first marriage is always the real mistress of the family; the rest are
often little better than her hand-maids.[2765] The same holds good for
the Burmese, according to Lieutenant-General Fytche; for the Santals,
according to Colonel Dalton.[2766] In Siam, “the wife who has been the
object of the marriage ceremony ‘khan mak’ takes precedence of all
the rest, and she and her descendants are the only legal heirs to the
husband’s possessions.”[2767] Among the Khamtis, Samoyedes,[2768] and
other Asiatic peoples,[2769] the first wife is always the mistress of
the household and the most respected in the family; whilst, among the
Ainos,[2770] Mongols, and Tangutans,[2771] one man can take only one
lawful wife, though as many concubines as he pleases. But, except among
the Ainos, the children of concubines are illegitimate and have no
share in the inheritance.

The polygyny of China is a legalized concubinage, and the law actually
prohibits the taking of a second wife during the lifetime of the
first.[2772] The wife is invested with a certain amount of power over
the concubines, who may not even sit in her presence without special
permission.[2773] She addresses her partner with a term corresponding
to our “husband,” whilst the concubines call him “master.”[2774]
These are generally women with large feet and of low origin, not
unfrequently slaves or prostitutes; whereas the wife is almost
invariably, except of course in the case of Tartar ladies, a woman
with small feet.[2775] A wife cannot be degraded to the position of
a concubine, nor can a concubine be raised to the position of a wife
so long as the wife is alive, under a penalty in the one case of a
hundred, in the other of ninety blows.[2776] But the question upon
which the legitimacy of the offspring depends, is not whether the woman
is wife or concubine, but whether she has been received into the house
of the man or not.[2777] In Mohammedan countries, in households where
two or more wives belong to one man, the first married generally enjoys
the highest rank; she is called “the great lady,” and is commonly
united with her husband for life. But all the children of the man are
considered equally legitimate, even those born of female slaves.[2778]

Among the negro peoples, the principal wife, to whom the housekeeping
and command over all the rest are intrusted, is in most cases the one
first married. She has certain privileges, and in many cases can be
repudiated only if she has been unfaithful to her husband.[2779] Among
the Edeeyahs of Fernando Po, it was for the first wife alone that a
man had to serve several years with his father-in-law.[2780] Speaking
of the Eastern Central African tribes, Mr. Macdonald says, “As a
rule, a man has one wife that is free, while the other three or four
are slaves.... The chief wife is generally the woman that was married
first.... The chief wife has the superintendence of the domestic and
agricultural establishment. She keeps the others at their work, and
has power to exercise discipline upon them.” Generally, it is only by
inheriting the possessions of an elder brother that a man procures more
than one free wife.[2781] Among the Damaras and other South African
tribes, the eldest son of the principal or first wife inherits his
father’s property.[2782] Speaking of the Basutos, Mr. Casalis observes,
“A very marked distinction exists between the first wife and those
who succeed her. The choice of the ‘great’ wife (as she is always
called) is generally made by the father, and is an event in which all
the relations are interested. The others, who are designated by the
name of ‘serete’ (heels), because they must on all occasions hold an
inferior position to the mistress of the house, are articles of luxury,
to which the parents are not obliged to contribute.” The chief of the
Basutos, when asked by foreigners how many children he has, alludes in
his answer only to those of his first wife; and, if he says he is a
widower, this means that he has lost his real wife, and has not raised
any of his concubines to the rank she occupied.[2783] Among the Zulus,
the chief wife is the one first married,[2784] and this is often, but
not always, the case among the Kafirs.[2785] According to Rochon,
polygyny in Madagascar is, in fact, a sort of concubinage.[2786]

Eber suggests that the kings of ancient Egypt, although they might
have many concubines, had only one real wife, as there is no
instance of two consorts given in the inscriptions.[2787] Professor
Rawlinson makes a similar remark as to the polygyny of the Persian
kings.[2788] Regarding the Hindus, Mr. Mayne says, “A peculiar
sanctity ... seems to have been attributed to the first marriage, as
being that which was contracted from a sense of duty, and not merely
for personal gratification. The first married wife had precedence
over the others, and her first-born son over his half-brothers. It
is probable that originally the secondary wives were considered as
merely a superior class of concubines, like the hand-maids of the
Jewish patriarchs.”[2789] It was necessary that the first married
wife should be of the same caste as her husband.[2790] She sat by him
at marriages and other religious ceremonies, was head of the family,
and entitled to adopt a son if she had no sons at the time of her
husband’s death.[2791] The modified polygyny of the ancient Assyrians
and Greeks has been already noted. The ancient Scandinavians had
almost always only one legitimate wife, though as many concubines
as they chose.[2792] Touching the Pagan Russians, Ewers says that
of the wives of a prince one probably had precedence.[2793] Among
the Mormons, Sir R. F. Burton observes, “the first wife, as among
polygamists generally, is _the_ wife and assumes the husband’s name and
title.”[2794]

The difference in the position held by the several wives belonging to
one man, shows itself also in the demand of various peoples that the
first wife shall be of the husband’s rank, whilst the succeeding wives
may be of lower birth.[2795]

As just mentioned, there is another way in which polygyny is modified.
Among certain peoples the husband is bound by custom or law to cohabit
with his wives in turn. The Caribs, when they married several sisters
at the same time, lived a month with each in her separate hut.[2796]
Among the wild Indians of Chili, according to Mr. Darwin, the cazique
lives a week in turn with each of his wives.[2797] The Kafirs have an
old traditional law requiring a husband who has many wives to devote
three succeeding days and nights to each of them.[2798] A Mohammedan
is obliged to visit his four legal wives by turns;[2799] and the same
custom prevails, according to Krasheninnikoff, in Kamchatka.[2800]
The negroes often follow a like rule in order to keep peace in the
family.[2801] And, in Samoa, the system adopted when a person has
several wives, “is to allow each wife to enjoy three days’ supremacy
in rotation.”[2802] But such arrangements are, no doubt, exceptions,
and it is doubtful whether, in these cases, theory and practice
coincide.[2803] A marriage may, in fact, be monogamous, though, from a
juridical point of view, it is polygynous.

“It is not uncommon for an Indian,” says Carver, “although he takes
to himself so many wives, to live in a state of continence with many of
them for several years,” and those who do not succeed in pleasing the
husband may “continue in their virgin state during the whole of their
lives.”[2804] Among the Apaches, the chiefs “can have any number of
wives they choose, but one only is the favourite.”[2805] In Bokhara,
a rich man generally has two, three, or four wives; yet, according
to Georgi, one of them, as a rule, holds precedence in the husband’s
love.[2806] Speaking of the modern Egyptians, Mr. Lane says, “In
general, the most beautiful of a man’s wives or slaves is, of course,
for a time his greatest favourite; but in many—if not most—cases,
the lasting favourite is not the most handsome.”[2807] Sometimes the
wife who has proved most fruitful and given birth to the healthiest
children is most favoured by the husband;[2808] and, among the Indians
of Western Washington and North-Western Oregon, according to Dr. Gibbs,
the man usually lives with his first wife, at least after his interest
in subsequent wives has cooled down.[2809] But it is generally the
youngest wife who is the favourite. An Arabian Sheik said to Sir S. W.
Baker, “I have four wives; as one has become old, I have replaced
her with a young one; here they all are (he now marked four strokes
upon the sand with his stick). This one carries water; that grinds the
corn; this makes the bread; the last does not do much, as she is the
youngest, and my favourite.”[2810] In Guiana, “an Indian is never
seen with two young wives; the only case in which he takes a second
is when the first has become old.” The first wife certainly retains
the management of domestic affairs, but she no longer possesses the
husband’s love.[2811] Statements to a similar effect are made regarding
the Arabs of the Sahara, Tahitians, Central Asiatic Turks, Mormons,
&c.[2812]

Bigamy is the most common form of polygyny, and a multitude of wives is
the luxury of a few despotic rulers or very wealthy men. The Eskimo,
for example, have rarely more than two wives, and a Greenlander who
took a third or fourth was blamed by his countrymen, as we are told
by Cranz.[2813] The tribes of Oregon generally confine themselves to
a couple of wives.[2814] Bishop Salvado never knew a West Australian
native with more than two—“à moins peut-être que par générosité un
homme ne prenne sous sa protection la femme de son ami ou parent
absent; ou bien que par voie d’hérédité il n’adopte les veuves de son
frère.”[2815] Rich Kafirs are stated to have commonly two or three
wives;[2816] and Colonel Dalton does not recollect that, among the
Khamtis, he ever met with a case in which more than two women were
married to one husband.[2817] The Hebrews who indulged in polygyny were
generally bigamists.[2818]

       *       *       *       *       *

Polyandry is a much rarer form of marriage than polygyny. In
Oonalashka, one of the Aleutian Islands, according to v. Langsdorf, a
woman sometimes lived with two husbands who agreed between themselves
upon the conditions on which they were to share her.[2819] Among the
Kaniagmuts, two or three men occasionally had a wife in common;[2820]
and Veniaminoff tells us that in ancient times a Thlinket woman,
besides her real husband, could have a legal paramour, who usually
was the brother of the husband.[2821] Among the Eskimo also, “two men
sometimes marry the same woman.”[2822] Father Lafitau writes, “Par
une suite de la Gynécocratie, la polygamie, qui n’est pas permise aux
hommes, l’est pourtant aux femmes chez les Iroquois Tsonnontouans,
où il en est, lesquelles ont deux maris, qu’on regarde comme
légitimes.”[2823] Among the Avanos and Maypurs, along the Orinoco, v.
Humboldt found that brothers often had but one wife;[2824] according to
Mr. Brett, the Warraus do not consider the practice of one woman having
two husbands to be bad; and he mentions an instance of a woman amongst
them having even three.[2825]

In Nukahiva, as we are told by Lisiansky, in rich families every
woman had two husbands, of whom one might be called the assistant
husband.[2826] In New Caledonia, according to M. Moncelon, polyandry
does not seem to have been entirely unknown;[2827] and Mr. Radfield
writes to me from Lifu that an old man knew of three cases of
polyandrous marriage having occurred in that island, but the husbands
were despised by the rest of the natives. In two of these cases the
husbands were brothers, in the third they were unrelated. It is said
that, among the Tasmanians, “polyandry, or something very like it,
existed;”[2828] but this statement, if correct, refers to altogether
exceptional cases.

Bontier and Le Verrier assert that, in the island of Lancerote, of the
Canaries, most women had three husbands.[2829] Thunberg observes that,
among the Hottentots, there were women who married two men.[2830] Dr.
Fritsch mentions the existence of polyandry among the Damaras, and
Mr. Theal among the mountain tribes of the Bantu race.[2831] The Hovas
of Madagascar have a word to express the leave given to a wife to have
intercourse with another man during a husband’s prolonged absence from
home.[2832]

Until prohibited by the governor, Sir Henry Ward, about the year 1860,
polyandry prevailed among the Sinhalese throughout the interior of
Ceylon, one woman having in many cases three or four husbands, and
in others five or six or even seven. It is recorded that the same
practice was at one time universal throughout the island, except among
the Veddahs,[2833] and even now it occurs in spite of government
interdict.[2834] The husbands are usually members of the same family,
and most frequently brothers.

Among the Todas, all brothers of one family, be they many or few, live
in mixed cohabitation with one or more wives. “If there be four or
five brothers,” says Dr. Shortt, “and one of them, being old enough,
gets married, his wife claims all the other brothers as her husbands,
and, as they successively attain manhood, she consorts with them; or,
if the wife has one or more younger sisters, they in turn, on attaining
a marriageable age, become the wives of their sister’s husband or
husbands.... Owing, however, to the great scarcity of women in this
tribe, it more frequently happens that a single woman is wife to
several husbands, sometimes as many as six.”[2835] The same practice
occurs among the Kurgs of Mysore.[2836] Among the Nairs of Malabar,
it is the custom for one woman “to have attached to her two males,
or four, or perhaps more, and they cohabit according to rules.”[2837]
Polyandry is also found among the Miris, Dophlas, Butlas,[2838]
Sissee Abors,[2839] Khasias,[2840] and Santals.[2841] It prevails
in the Siwalik mountains, Sirmore,[2842] Ladakh,[2843] the Jounsar
and Bawar hill districts attached to the Doon,[2844] Kunawar,[2845]
Kotegarh,[2846] and, especially, in Tibet. This custom exists, as
Mr. Wilson asserts, “all over the country of the Tibetan-speaking
people; that is to say, from China to the dependencies of Kashmir
and Afghanistan, with the exception of Sikkim, and some other of the
provinces on the Indian side of the Himalaya, where, though the Tibetan
language may in part prevail, yet the people are either Aryan in race,
or have been much influenced by Aryan ideas.”[2847] Polyandry is said
to occur among the Saporogian Cossacks;[2848] and Mr. Ravenstein
quotes a statement of a Japanese traveller that it prevails among the
Smerenkur Gilyaks in Eastern Siberia.[2849]

With the exception of the Nairs, Khasias, and Saporogian Cossacks, the
husbands in almost every one of these cases are stated to be brothers.
A colonel who lived among the Kulus of Kotegarh for twenty-five
years assures us that, among that people, the husbands are always
brothers;[2850] and, so far as Mr. Wilson could learn, the polyandry
of Central Asia must be limited to the marriage of one woman to two or
more brothers, no other form being found there.[2851]

A very curious kind of polyandry prevails, according to Dr. Shortt,
among the Reddies. It often happens that a young woman of sixteen
or twenty years of age is married to a boy of five or six years, or
even of a tenderer age. After marriage the wife lives with some other
man, a near relation on the maternal side, frequently an uncle, and
sometimes with her boy-husband’s own father, the progeny so begotten
being affiliated to the boy-husband. When he comes of age he finds his
wife an old woman, and perhaps past child-bearing. So he, in his turn,
takes possession of the wife of some other boy, who will nominally be
the father of her children.[2852] A similar custom is said to exist
among the Vellalah caste in the Coimbore district,[2853] and prevailed,
till the emancipation of the serfs, among the Russian peasants, the
father being in the habit of cohabiting with the wife of his son during
the son’s minority.[2854] Ahlqvist mentions the occurrence of the same
practice among the Ostyaks,[2855] v. Haxthausen among the Ossetes.[2856]

Passing to ancient nations, we find indications of polyandry in a hymn
in the ‘Rig-Veda,’ which is addressed to the two Aświns,[2857], and
in the Mahâbhârata, where Draupadi is represented as won at an archery
match by the eldest of the five Pandava princes, and as then becoming
the wife of all. According to Strabo, polyandry occurred in Media, and
in Arabia Felix, where all male members of the same family married
one woman.[2858] Ma-touan-lin states that, among the Massagetæ, the
brothers had one wife in common, and when a man had no brothers he
associated with other men, as otherwise he was obliged to live single
through the whole of his life.[2859] We have in the Irish Nennius
direct evidence of the existence of polyandry among the Picts,[2860]
and of the ancient Britons Cæsar says that “by tens and by twelves
husbands possessed their wives in common, and especially brothers
with brothers, and parents with children.”[2861] Among the ancient
Scandinavians we possibly find a trace of this custom in the mythic
statement that the goddess Frigg, during the absence of her husband
Odin, was married to his brothers Vili and Ve.[2862]

Among the peoples of America, Africa, and the Pacific Islands, just
referred to, polyandry, in almost every case, is confined to a very
small part of the population; and among the polyandrous nations
of India and Central Asia it is by no means the exclusive form
of marriage. Sir Emerson Tennent says that, in Ceylon, polyandry
prevails chiefly among the wealthier classes, whilst, according to
Dr. Davy, it is “more or less general among the high and low, the
rich and poor,” other forms of marriage, however, being by no means
excluded.[2863] Among the Todas, “any degree of complication in
perfectly lawful wedded life may be met with, from the sample of
the single man living with the single wife, to that of the group of
relatives married to a group of wives.”[2864] Mr. Balfour says that
“the practice of polyandry does not seem to have ever prevailed
generally amongst the Nairs and many of the Teeyer of North Malabar,
from Kurumbranad to Mangalore.”[2865] Among the Miris there are only
a few instances of this custom.[2866] Of the Dophlas those who can
afford it are polygynists.[2867] Among the Khasias, polyandry “can be
said to prevail only among the poorer sort, with whom, too, it would
often seem to mean rather facility of divorce than the simultaneous
admission of a plurality of husbands.”[2868] Among the Santals, the
wife of the eldest brother _may_ be at the same time a wife for the
younger brothers also.[2869] The Sissee Abors have often as many wives
as they can afford to buy;[2870] and in the Kunawar valley, polyandry
is common only in the upper part of the valley, whilst polygyny
prevails in the lower part.[2871] In the Kotegarh valley, according
to Dr. Stulpnagel, the practice of polyandry is not universal; it
can scarcely be said to be even very common. “If diligently searched
for,” he observes, “single cases of polyandry will be found in the
Kôtgadh parganâ, in Kulu, in the territory of the Rânâs of Komarsen
and Kaneti, and in Bussahir.... Though common enough in Kunawar at
the present day, it exists side by side with polygamy and monogamy.
In one house there may be three brothers with one wife; in the next
three brothers with four wives, all alike in common; in the next house
there may be a man with three wives to himself; in the next a man with
only one wife.”[2872] Among the Butias, or Botis, of Ladakh, according
to Sir Alexander Cunningham, polyandry prevails “only among the
poorer classes, for the rich, as in all Eastern countries, generally
have two or three wives, according to their circumstances.”[2873]
In the Jounsar and Bawah pargannahs, polyandry is almost universal,
but it is apparently unknown in the hills of Garhwal on the east,
or those of the Simla superintendency on the west.[2874] Nowhere,
except perhaps in the Neilgherry Hills, has polyandry prevailed more
extensively than in Tibet; but it is not the only form of marriage.
According to Captain J. D. Cunningham, “even among the Lamaic
Tibetans any casual influx of wealth, as from trade or other sources,
immediately leads to the formation of separate establishments by the
several members of a house.”[2875] We may thus take for granted that
polyandry, although frequently practised in certain parts of India and
Central Asia,[2876] nowhere excludes the simultaneous occurrence of
other forms of marriage. The instances of ancient Aryan polyandry in
India evidently form exceptions to the general rule among the people
of the Vedic period. The father of Draupadi is represented by the
compilers of the epic as shocked at the proposal of the princes to
marry his daughter:—“You who know the law,” he says, “must not commit
an unlawful act which is contrary to usage and the Vedas.” In the
Râmâyana, the giant Virâdha attacks the two divine brothers Râma and
Lakshmana and their wife Sítâ, saying, “Why do you two devotees remain
with one woman? Why are you, O profligate wretches, corrupting the
devout sages?”[2877] And in the ‘Aitareya Brâhmana’ we read that “one
man has many wives, but one wife has not many husbands at the same
time.”[2878] Indeed, with the exception of the Massagetæ, the account
of whom cannot be critically checked, there is no people among whom
polyandry is stated to be the only recognized form of marriage.

Like polygyny, polandry is modified in directions tending towards
monogamy. As one, usually the first married, wife in polygynous
families is the chief wife, one, usually the first, husband in
polyandrous families is the chief husband. This was the case with
the Aleuts, among whom, according to Erman, the secondary husband
was generally a hunter or wandering trader; and with the Kaniagmuts,
among whom, as we have already seen, he acted as husband and master
of the house during the absence of the true lord. Upon the latter’s
return, the deputy not only yielded to him his place, but became in
the meantime his servant.[2879] In Nukahiva, the subordinate partner
sometimes was chosen after marriage, “but in general,” says Lisiansky,
“two men present themselves to the same woman, who, if she approves
their addresses, appoints one for the real husband, and the other
as his auxiliary; the auxiliary is generally poor, but handsome and
well-made.”[2880]

In Ladakh, according to Moorcraft and Trebeck, should there be several
brothers in a family, the juniors, if they agree to the arrangement,
become inferior husbands to the wife of the elder; all the children,
however, are supposed to belong to the head of the family. The younger
brothers have, indeed, no authority; they wait upon the elder as his
servants, and can be turned out of doors at his pleasure, without
its being incumbent upon him to provide for them. On the death of
the eldest brother, his property, authority, and widow devolve upon
his next brother.[2881] In Kamaon, too, where the brothers of a
family all marry one wife, the children are attributed to the eldest
brother.[2882] The same is the case in the Jounsar district, as it
was formerly with the Massagetæ.[2883] Touching the polyandrous
tribes of Arabia Felix, Strabo tells us that the eldest brother was
the ruler of the family, and that the common wife spent the nights
with him.[2884] Among the ancient Britons, as described by Cæsar, the
children were regarded as belonging to him who had first taken the
virgin to wife.[2885] In Tibet, the choice of a wife is the right of
the elder brother, and the contract he makes is understood to involve
a marital contract with all the other brothers, if they choose to
avail themselves of it. The children call the eldest husband father,
the younger husbands uncles.[2886] Among the Todas also, the eldest
brother seems to be the real husband. “If the husband has brothers or
very near relatives, all living together,” says Mr. Marshall, “they
may each, if both she and he consent, participate in the right to be
considered her husband also, on making up a share of the dowry that has
been paid.”[2887] Again, in Spiti, where polyandry no longer prevails,
the same object is attained by the custom of primogeniture, by which
only the eldest son marries, while the younger sons become monks.[2888]
Speaking of the Khyoungtha, a Chittagong Hill tribe, Captain Lewin
observes, “After marriage a younger brother is allowed to touch the
hand, to speak and laugh with his elder brother’s wife; but it is
thought improper for an elder even to look at the wife of his younger
brother. This is a custom more or less among all hill tribes; it is
found carried to even a preposterous extent among the Santals.”[2889]
In this custom there is perhaps a trace of ancient polyandry.

       *       *       *       *       *

Summing up the results reached in this chapter, we may safely say that,
although polygyny occurs among most existing peoples, and polyandry
among some, monogamy is by far the most common form of human marriage.
It was so also among the ancient peoples of whom we have any direct
knowledge. Monogamy is the form which is generally recognized as
legal and permitted. The great majority of peoples are, as a rule,
monogamous, and the other forms of marriage are usually modified in a
monogamous direction.

We have still to inquire how the matter stood in early times, and to
trace the general development of the forms of human marriage. But, in
accordance with our method of investigation, we must first examine the
causes by which these forms have been influenced.




CHAPTER XXI

THE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE

(_Continued_)


It has also been asserted that monogamy is the natural form of human
marriage because there is an almost equal number of men and women. But
this is by no means the case. The numerical proportion between the
sexes varies, and in some cases varies greatly, among different peoples.

In the whole district of Nutka, it seemed to Meares that there were
not so many women as men, whereas, further north, the women decidedly
preponderated.[2890] Among the Kutchin, according to Kirby, women
form the minority;[2891] and they seem to hold the same position
among the Upper Californians and Western Eskimo.[2892] But as a rule,
among the North American aborigines, the opposite is apparently the
case. Thus there are more women than men among certain Eskimo tribes,
according to Dr. King; among the natives of the Sitka Islands,
according to Lisiansky; among the Californian Shastika, according to
Mr. Powers.[2893] The census of the Creeks taken in the year 1832
showed 6,555 men and 7,142 women; that of the Indian population around
Lakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, the Upper Mississippi, &c., in
the same year, 3,144 men and 3,571 women, excluding children, that
of the Nez Percés in Oregon, taken in 1851 by Dr. Dart, 698 men and
1,182 women.[2894] Among the Blackfeet and Shiyann, according to Mr.
Morgan—among the Puncahs and some other tribes, according to Mr.
Catlin—the number of women is said to be twice as large as that of men,
and in some cases even three times as large.[2895]

In Yucatan, according to Stephens, there are two women to one man;
among the Guaranies, according to Azara, fourteen women to thirteen
men; in Cochabamba, according to Gibbon, even five to one.[2896]
Among the Zapotecs and other nations of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,
the women are greatly in excess of the men;[2897] whereas, among the
Tarumas,[2898] Avanos, Maypurs,[2899] and Guanas,[2900] the men are
stated to be more numerous than the women. Von Martius says that among
the Indians of Brazil, the number varied in some villages in favour of
the male sex, in others in favour of the female.[2901]

In Australia the men seem generally to be in the majority.[2902]
Speaking of the Australian natives, the Rev. L. Fison says, “I think
we may suppose that the number of males generally exceeds that of
females among the lower savages; at least, quite a number of observers
declare that such is the fact.”[2903] Among the Western Australians,
according to Mr. Oldfield, at all times the males are in excess of the
other sex.”[2904] Wilhelmi makes a similar statement with regard to
several other tribes;[2905] but this rule does not apply to all the
Australians. “On Herbert River,” says Herr Lumholtz, “the women are
more numerous than the men; this is also the case among the tribes
south-west of the Carpentarian Gulf and elsewhere. But, according to
accurate observations, the opposite is the case in a large part of
Australia.”[2906] In some tribes of the interior, Mr. Sturt found that
among children there were about two girls to one boy.[2907]

In Tasmania, according to Breton, the men greatly exceeded the women
in number.[2908] So also in Tahiti, where, at the time of Mr. Ellis’s
arrival, there were probably four or five men to one woman;[2909] in
Maupiti, where the disproportion between the sexes among adults was
at the rate of three men to two women;[2910] and in Easter Island,
where, according to the estimates of Cook and La Pérouse, the men
were twice as numerous as the women.[2911] In the Sandwich Islands,
Nukahiva, and some islands belonging to the Solomon Group, the male
sex predominated;[2912] and among the Maoris, according to a census
taken in the year 1881, there were 24,370 men and 19,729 women.[2913]
In Makin Island, of the Kingsmill Group, on the other hand, Wood
represented the women as outnumbering the men.[2914] The same was to a
very great extent the case in Tukopia;[2915] and d’Albertis says that
in Naiabui, a village in New Guinea with 300 inhabitants, “there are
more women than men by about a third.”[2916] Both sexes are nearly
equally represented at Port Moresby,[2917] and according to Marsden,
in Sumatra.[2918] In Sarawak the women are less numerous than the
men.[2919]

In Ceylon a considerable disparity is exhibited by the returns.
According to Pridham, it is found in the greatest degree among the
Sinhalese, among whom the surplus of men averages twelve per cent.,
but it is also observable in the case of the Malabar population in
the northern province, where the surplus of men averages six per
cent.[2920] Robert Orme states that, in India, the number of women
exceeds that of men;[2921] but this is certainly not the case in every
part of the country. In a census of the North-West Provinces, taken
during the year 1866, the proportions between the sexes were found to
be 100 men to 86·6 women, and, in the Panjab, even 100 to 81·8.[2922]
In some districts of the Himalayas there is a surplus of males, in
others of females.[2923] In Kashmir, the proportion of men to women
is as three to one.[2924] In the Buddhist country of Ladakh, says Sir
A. Cunningham, “it will be observed that the females outnumber the
males, while the reverse is the case in the Mussulman districts along
the Indus.”[2925] In Malwa, in Central India, the number of women
surpasses the number of men,[2926] and the same, according to Sir John
Bowring, is to a great extent the case in China.[2927] The Todas of
the Neilgherry Hills, on the other hand, amounted in the year 1867,
according to Mr. Breeks, to 455 males and 249 females of all ages,
whilst Mr. Marshall some few years ago found the Toda males of all
ages bear the proportion to females of all ages of 100 to 75.[2928]
Among the Mongols, as we are informed by Prejevalsky, “the women
are far less numerous than the men;”[2929] and the same is said to
have been the case with the Massagetæ, and to be the case still in
Kamchatka.[2930]

As for the peoples of Africa, I have found two cases only of an excess
of men, the one among the population of Galega, to the north-east of
Madagascar, the other among the Quissama tribe in Angola.[2931] The
reverse seems decidedly to be the rule. Thus, from Morocco Dr. Churcher
writes to me that “there appears to be a striking disproportion,
though there is no such thing as statistics in this land.” In Ma
Bung, in the Timannee country, Major Laing counted three women to one
man.[2932] A census taken in Lagos in 1872 showed among the population
of African origin, 27,774 men and 32,353 women.[2933] Among the Negroes
of the Gold Coast, according to Bosman; in Latúka, according to Emin
Pasha; among the Waguha of West Tanganyika, according to Mr. A. J.
Swann; among the Wa-taïta, according to Mr. Joseph Thomson, women
predominate.[2934] Mr. Cousins is inclined to think that the same is
the case with the Cis-Natalian Kafirs, “as there are few bachelors,
and the majority of men have more than one wife.”[2935] In Uganda, says
the Rev. C. T. Wilson, “the female population is largely in excess of
the male, the proportion being about three and a half to one.”[2936]

In European countries, the number of men and of women from fifteen to
twenty years of age is generally almost the same; but in an earlier
period of life there are more men than women, and, in a later, more
women than men.[2937]

This disparity in the numbers of the sexes is due to various causes.
The preponderance of women depends to a great extent upon the higher
mortality of men. Dr. Sutherland found that the average age of 109
Eskimo was nearly 22 years—that of the females 24·5, that of the males
19·3 years.[2938] The men pass most of their time at sea, in snow and
rain, heat and cold, and many of them are drowned. The result of this
troublesome and dangerous life is that few of them attain the age of
fifty, whereas many women reach the age of seventy or even eighty.
This, according to Dr. King, is the reason why, among this people,
there are generally fewer men than women.[2939] Mr. Bancroft states
that, among the Ingaliks near the mouth of the Yukon, some of the
women reach sixty, while the men rarely attain more than forty-five
years.[2940] In Europe, the death-rate is higher among men than among
women, partly because of the greater dangers they are exposed to. Among
many savage and barbarous peoples, however, the greater mortality of
the male population depends chiefly upon the destructive influence of
war.[2941] “As all nations of Indians in their natural condition,”
says Mr. Catlin, “are unceasingly at war with the tribes that are
about them, ... their warriors are killed off to that extent, that in
many instances two, or sometimes three women to a man are found in a
tribe.”[2942] According to Ellis, it is supposed by the Missionaries
in Madagascar that, in consequence of the destructive ravages of war,
in some of the provinces there are among the free portion of the
inhabitants five, and in other three, women to one man, whilst the
proportion of the sexes seems to be equal at birth.[2943] But I am
inclined to think that this cause operates principally at tolerably
advanced stages of civilization, and only in a smaller degree among
the rudest savages, who, devoid of any definite tribal organization,
live a wandering life, scattered in families or hordes consisting of
a few persons. Thus, with regard to the Yahgans of Tierra del Fuego,
Mr. Bridges writes to me, “On several occasions when some hundreds
of natives have been gathered together, I have taken censuses of
them, and have always found the sexes equal or nearly so.... War was
unknown, though fightings were frequent, but women took part in them as
energetically as the men, and suffered equally with them—if anything,
more.” Among the Australians also, as we have seen, wars do not cause
any disproportion between the sexes.

The surplus of males is often due to female infanticide;[2944] and
among certain peoples there is another cause which must be taken into
account. Captain Lewin states that, among the Toungtha, women die at a
comparatively early age because of the constant labour which their sex
entails upon them, whereas the men live very long.[2945] And the same
is said by Mr. Kirby with regard to the Kutchin.[2946]

Moreover, there is a disproportion between the sexes at birth. Among
some peoples more boys are born, among others more girls; and the
surplus is often considerable. Mr. Ross thinks that, among the Eastern
Tinneh, “the proportion of births is rather in favour of females,”
whilst the Aht women seem to have more boys than girls.[2947] Von
Humboldt found by examining baptismal registers, that more boys than
girls were born in some communities of New Spain.[2948] The same,
according to M. Belly, is the case among the Indians of Guatemala and
Nicaragua.[2949]

In the interior of Australia, Mr. Sturt met with several smaller tribes
in which the number of girls was considerably greater than the number
of boys, though in other tribes the proportion of births is in favour
of males.[2950] Sir. G. Grey drew up a list of 222 births, and of these
93 were females, 129 males.[2951] In Tasmania, where the men were more
numerous than the women, female infanticide was very rare.[2952] The
same is the case with the Sinhalese. They hold in abhorrence the crime
of exposing children, says Dr. Davy; and it is never committed except
in some of the wildest parts of the country, and even there only when
the parents themselves are on the brink of starvation, and must either
sacrifice a part of the family or die.[2953] Haeckel assures us that
among this people there is a permanent disproportion between male and
female births, ten boys being born, on the average, to eight or nine
girls.[2954] Among the Todas, as we are informed by Mr. Marshall, the
male children under fourteen years of age bear to the female children
of the same period—ages estimated from their personal appearance—the
ratio of 100 to 80·0,[2955] though female infanticide is never
practised, having long since become extinct through the action of the
British Government.[2956] Mr. Man’s inquiries tended to show that,
among the Andamanese, there is a slight predominance of female over
male births.[2957]

Bruce observes, “From a diligent inquiry into the South and
Scripture-part of Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Syria, from Mousul (or
Nineveh) to Aleppo and Antioch, I find the proportion to be fully
two women born to one man. There is indeed, a fraction over, but
not a considerable one. From Latikea, Laodicea ad mare, down the
coast of Syria to Sidon, the number is very nearly three, or two and
three-fourths to one man. Through the Holy Land, the country called
Horan, in the Isthmus of Suez, and the parts of the Delta, unfrequented
by strangers, it is something less than three. But from Suez to the
Straits of Babelmandeb, which contains the three Arabias, the portion
is fully four women to one man, which, I have reason to believe, holds
as far as the Line, and 30° beyond it.” The manner in which Bruce
came to these conclusions he describes as follows:—“Whenever I went
into a town, village, or inhabited place, dwelt long in a mountain,
or travelled journeys with any set of people, I always made it my
business to inquire how many children they had, or their fathers, their
next neighbours, or acquaintance. This not being a captious question,
or what any one would scruple to answer, there was no interest to
deceive.... I say, therefore, that a medium of both sexes arising from
three or four hundred families indiscriminately taken, shall be the
proportion in which one differs from the other.”[2958]

This statement has been contradicted, but, so far as I know, it has not
been proved to be wholly without foundation. It is to some extent made
credible by what Dr. Churcher informs me regarding the disproportion
of the sexes among the Moors of Morocco. As the result of his own
observation, and that of a Mohammedan friend of his, he writes, “There
is certainly a disproportion also at birth.... It would be safe to say
that the female births are in the proportion of three females to one
male; this partly accounts for the great rejoicing when a son is born.
It reacts, however, in this way, that the people say, ‘Allah has given
us more women than men, hence it is evident that polygamy is of God.’”
In the Monbuttu country, according to Emin Pasha, “far more female
children are born than males.”[2959] And, regarding the disproportion
between the sexes in Uganda, Mr. Wilson says, “Careful observation
has established the fact that there are a good many more female births
than male, and, on taking the groups of children playing by the
roadside, there will always be found to be more girls than boys.”[2960]
Confronted by these definite statements, and by the fact that, in many
African countries, there is a striking excess of women, we cannot with
Süssmilch and Chervin[2961] dismiss as wholly groundless Montesquieu’s
well-known assertion that in the hot regions of the Old World more
girls are born than boys,[2962] although such disproportion certainly
does not exist in every tropical country.

In Europe, the average male births outnumber the female by about five
per cent., the still-born being excluded. But the rate varies in the
different countries. Thus, in Russian Poland, only 101 boys are born
to 100 girls, whilst, in Roumania and Greece, the proportion is 111 to
100.[2963] The excess of male over female births is less when they are
illegitimate than when legitimate.[2964]

       *       *       *       *       *

Ever since Aristotle’s days inquirers have sought to discover the
causes which determine the sex of the offspring; but no conclusion
commanding general assent has yet been arrived at. The law of Hofacker
and Sadler, according to which more boys are born if the husband
is older than the wife, more girls if the wife is older than the
husband, has attracted the greatest number of adherents.[2965] But
Noirot and Breslau have lately come to the opposite result, and, from
the data of Norwegian statistics, Berner has shown that the law is
untenable.[2966] Dr. Goehlert has modified it so far that he holds the
sex to be influenced, not by the relative, but by the absolute ages
of the parents.[2967] But W. Stieda has found from the registers of
births in Alsace-Lorraine, that neither the relative nor the absolute
ages of the parents exercise this sort of influence.[2968] Again,
Platter, in a paper in ‘Statistische Monatsschrift’ (Vienna) for 1875,
concludes from the examination of thirty million births that the less
the difference in the age of the parents the greater is the probability
of boys being born.[2969]

It has, further, been suggested that polygyny leads to the birth
of a greater proportion of female infants.[2970] Dr. J. Campbell,
however, who carefully attended to this subject in the harems of Siam,
concludes that the proportion of male to female births is the same
as from monogamous unions.[2971] It has also been maintained, in a
paper read before the “Anthropological Institute of Great Britain
and Ireland” by Mr. John Sanderson, that, among the Kafirs resident
in Natal and the adjoining countries, there was no surplus of female
births in polygynous families.[2972] The mass of facts collected by
Mr. Sanderson is, however, too small to warrant any positive general
deductions, and the like must be said of the information on the subject
which Mr. Cousins and Mr. Eyles have sent me from the same part of
South Africa. According to M. Remy and Mr. Hyde, on the other hand, the
censuses of the Mormons show a great excess of female births.[2973]
But it is impossible to believe that polygynous intercourse _per se_
can cause such an excess. Hardly any animal, as Mr. Darwin remarks,
has been rendered so highly polygynous as English race-horses;
nevertheless, their male and female offspring are almost exactly equal
in number.[2974]

Of all the theories relating to this subject, the one set forth by
Dr. Düsing[2975] is by far the most important. According to him, the
characters of animals and plants which influence the formation of
sex are due to natural selection. In every species, the proportion
between the sexes has a tendency to keep constant, but the organisms
are so well adapted to the conditions of life that, under anomalous
circumstances, they produce more individuals of that sex of which
there is the greatest need. When nourishment is abundant, strengthened
reproduction is an advantage to the species, whereas the reverse is
the case when nourishment is scarce. Hence—the power of multiplication
depending chiefly upon the number of females—organisms, when unusually
well nourished, produce comparatively more female offspring; in the
opposite case, more male. Dr. Düsing and, before him, Dr. Ploss,[2976]
have adduced several remarkable facts which seem to indicate that such
a connection between abundance and the production of females, and
between scarcity and the production of males, actually exists. It is,
for example, a common opinion among furriers that rich regions give
more female furs, poor regions more male.[2977] It is an established
fact that male births are in greater excess in country districts,
the population of which is often badly fed, than in towns, where the
conditions of life are shown to be, as a rule, more luxurious.[2978] A
similar excess is found among poor people as compared with the well-off
classes.[2979] Especially remarkable is Dr. Ploss’s statement that in
highlands comparatively more boys are born than in lowlands. He found
that, in Saxony, in the years 1847-1849, the proportion between male
and female births was 105·9 to 100 in the region not exceeding 500
Paris feet above the level of the sea; 107·3 to 100, at a height of
between 1,001 and 1,500 feet; and 107·8 to 100, at a height of between
1,501 and 2,000.[2980]

The evidence adduced by Dr. Ploss and Dr. Düsing is certainly not
strong enough to permit us to regard their inference otherwise than as
an hypothesis. But it is an hypothesis in which there seems to be some
truth. There are ethnological facts which fully harmonize with it.

According to the census made by the collectors of districts in 1814,
the whole population of the old English possessions in Ceylon formed
a grand total of 475,883 souls, the males outnumbering the females
by 27,193. Above the age of puberty there were 156,447 males, and
142,453 females; below that age, 95,091 males, and 81,892 females.
Davy, who thinks that the census is not far from the truth, remarks,
“The disproportion appears to be greatest in the poorest parts of the
country, where the population is thinnest, and it is most difficult
to support life; and smallest where there is least want. Indeed, in
some of the fishing villages, where there is abundance of food, the
number of females rather exceeds that of the males. May it not be a
wise provision of provident Nature to promote, by extreme poverty, the
generation of males rather than of females?”[2981]

Very remarkable is the striking coincidence of polyandry with the
great poverty of the countries in which it prevails. It seems to be
beyond doubt that this practice, as a rule, is due to scarcity of
women. This is the view taken by most of the authorities to whom we
owe our knowledge of polyandrous peoples.[2982] And this disproportion
between the sexes cannot, at least in many instances, be explained
as a result of female infanticide. It was formerly said that the
excess of men among the Todas was owing to the fact that all the
girls beyond a certain number were destroyed in the cradle; but later
investigations, as we have seen, show that the excess depends upon a
striking disproportion between male and female births. Dr. Seemann
states that, among those Eskimo tribes who practise polyandry, and
among whom men are more numerous than women, female infanticide seems
to be unknown.[2983] With regard to the inhabitants of the Jounsar
district of the Himalayas, Mr. Dunlop says, “Wherever the practice of
polyandry exists, there is a striking discrepance in the proportions of
the sexes among young children as well as adults; thus, in a village
where I have found upwards of four hundred boys, there were only one
hundred and twenty girls, yet the temptations to female infanticide,
owing to expensive marriages and extravagant dowers which exist among
the Rajputs of the plains, are not found in the hills where the
marriages are comparatively inexpensive, and where the wife, instead
of bringing a large dowry, is usually purchased for a considerable
sum from her parents. In the Garhwal Hills, moreover, where polygamy
is prevalent, there is a surplus of female children.... I am inclined
to give more weight to Nature’s adaptability to national habit, than
to the possibility of infanticide being the cause of the discrepance
found in Jounsar.”[2984] Female infants are killed only where they
are a burden to the family or community to which they belong. But it
will be shown subsequently that this is by no means the case with the
inhabitants of the Himalayas. Hence it seems almost probable that,
among the polyandrous peoples of these regions, as among the Todas and
Sinhalese, more boys are born than girls.

It has been said that Tibetan polyandry depends upon the scarcity of
women in a marriageable state, and that this scarcity is due to the
Lama nunneries absorbing so many of the girls.[2985] But Koeppen clears
the religion of Tibet of any responsibility for polyandry, showing
that the practice existed in the country before the introduction
of Buddhism.[2986] Mr. Baber states the very remarkable fact that
“polygamy obtains in valleys, while polyandry prevails in the
uplands.”[2987] According to Mr. Rockhill, “female infanticide is not
practised in Tibet, except among the women married to Chinese;”[2988]
and Grosier and Du Halde expressly assert that more males than females
are born there.[2989]

Much stress must be laid on the fact that polyandry prevails chiefly
in poor countries. “Polyandry,” says Lieutenant Cunningham, “appears
to be essential in a country in which the quantity of cultivable land
is limited, and in which pastures are not extensive, in which there
are but few facilities for carrying on commerce, and in which there
is no mineral wealth readily made available.”[2990] “Il est connu,”
says M. Vinson, “que sur la côte de Malabar la polyandrie a été
établie pour obvier à la pénurie des subsistances.”[2991] The Santals
live in a country a great part of which is poor and sterile.[2992]
Regarding the Kunawari, Miss Gordon Cumming remarks, “There is a
curious distinction in the social customs of the people in the upper
and lower part of this valley. Below Wangtu it is said that polygamy
prevails, as elsewhere; every man buying his wives from their parents
for a given number of rupees.... Farther up the valley, however, where
the people are very poor, and the tiny ridges of cultivation will not
support large families, polyandry is common.”[2993] Speaking of the
Botis of Ladakh, Sir A. Cunningham asserts that polyandry “was a most
politic measure for a poor country which does not produce sufficient
food for its inhabitants.”[2994] Mr. Bellew holds the same view with
regard to polyandry in Lammayru in Ladakh:—“The population is kept
down to a proportion which the country is capable of supporting. For
the only parts of it which are habitable are the narrow valleys through
which its rivers flow, and the little nooks in the mountains which
are watered by their torrent tributaries.”[2995] According to Mr.
Wilson, even one of the Moravian missionaries defended the polyandry
of the Tibetans “as good for the heathen of so sterile a country,”
since superabundant population in an unfertile country, would be a
great calamity and produce “eternal warfare or eternal want.”[2996]
A similar opinion is pronounced by Koeppen, Turner, de Ujfalvy, and
Wilson.[2997]

It is commonly asserted that this coincidence of polyandry with poverty
of material resources depends upon the intention of the people to check
an increase of population, or upon the fact that the men are not rich
enough to support or buy wives for themselves. But the accuracy of
these assumptions is very doubtful. Among no polyandrous people, except
the Tibetans with their nunneries do we know of a class of unmarried
women. Moreover, even if a woman is sometimes a burden to her husband
in a tribe that lives by hunting, her position is very different among
a pastoral or agricultural people. In the Himalayas, as Mr. Fraser
remarks, women are useful in the fields and in domestic labours, and
fully earn their own subsistence.[2998] Again, Turner, who had many
opportunities of seeing Western Tibet, asserts that polyandry there is
not confined to the lower ranks alone, but is frequently found in the
most opulent families,—a statement with which Mr. Wilson agrees.[2999]
In Ceylon, as we have seen, it prevails chiefly among the wealthier
classes.[3000] And in the villages of the Kotegarh district in the
Himalayas, according to Dr. Stulpnagel, most of the cases of polyandry
are found among well-to-do peoples. “It is the poor,” he says, “who
prefer polygamy, on account of the value of the women as household
drudges.”[3001] All these facts are certainly in favour of Dr. Düsing’s
theory; and Dr. Floss’s statement as to the excess of male births in
the highlands of Saxony becomes very important when we consider that
polyandry chiefly occurs among mountaineers—in South Africa, as we have
seen, as well as in Asia.

Dr. Düsing has, moreover, inferred that incest is less common in
proportion as the number of males is great. The more males, he says,
the farther off they have to go from their birthplace to find mates.
Incest is injurious to the species; hence incestuous unions have a
tendency to produce an excess of male offspring.[3002] Thus, according
to Dr. Nagel, certain plants, when self-fertilized, produce an excess
of male flowers. According to Dr. Goehlert’s statistical investigation,
in the case of horses, the more the parent animals differ in colour,
the more the female foals outnumber the male.[3003] Among the Jews,
many of whom marry cousins, there is a remarkable excess of male
births. In country districts where, as we have seen, comparatively
more boys are born than in towns, marriage more frequently takes place
between kinsfolk. It is for a similar reason, says Dr. Düsing, that
illegitimate unions show a tendency to produce female births.[3004]

The evidence given by Dr. Düsing for the correctness of his deduction
is, then, exceedingly scanty—if, indeed, it can be called evidence.
Nevertheless, I think his main conclusion holds good. Independently
of his reasoning, I had come to exactly the same result in a purely
inductive way. There is some ground for believing that mixture of
race produces an excess of female births. In his work on the ‘Tribes
of California,’ Mr. Powers observes, “It is a curious fact, which
has frequently come under my observation, and has been abundantly
confirmed by the pioneers, that among half-breed children a decided
majority are girls.... Often I have seen whole families of half-breed
girls, but never one composed entirely of boys, and seldom one wherein
they were more numerous.”[3005] When I mentioned this statement to a
gentleman who had spent many years in British Columbia and other parts
of North America, he replied that he himself had made exactly the same
observation. Mr. Starkweather has found that, according to the United
States statistical tables of the sex of mulattoes born in the Southern
States, there is an excess of from 12 to 15 per cent. of female mulatto
children, whilst, taking the whole population together, the male births
show an excess of 5 per cent.[3006] In Central America, according to
Colonel Galindo, “an extraordinary excess is observable in the births
of white and Ladino females over those of the males, the former being
in proportion to the latter as six, or at least as five, to four: among
the Indians the births of males and females are about equal.”[3007] Mr.
Stephens asserts that, among the Ladinos of Yucatan, the proportion is
even as two to one.[3008] Taken in connection with the fact mentioned
by Mr. Squier, that the whites in Central America are as one to eight
in comparison with the mixed population,[3009] these statements
accord well with the following observation of M. Belly as regards
Nicaragua:—“Ce qui me paraît être le fait général,” he says, “c’est
que dans les villes où l’élément blanc domine, il se procrée en effet
plus de filles que de garçons.... Mais dans les campagnes et partout
où la race Indienne l’emporte, c’est le contraire qui se produit,
et dès lors la prépondérance du sexe masculin se maintient par la
prépondérance de l’élément indigène. Le même phénomène avait déjà été
observé au Mexique.”[3010]

Concerning the proportion of the sexes at birth among the mixed races
of South America, I have unfortunately no definite statements at my
disposal. But Mr. J. S. Roberton informs me, from Chañaral in Chili,
that in that country, with its numerous mongrels, more females are born
than males. According to the list of the population of the capitaina
of São Paulo, in the year 1815, given by v. Spix and v. Martius—a list
which includes more than 200,000 persons,—the proportion between women
and men is, among the mulattoes, 114·65 to 100; among the whites,
109·3 to 100; among the blacks, 100 to 129.[3011] But this last
proportion is of no consequence, as we have no account of the number
of negro slaves annually imported into the capitaina. Sir R. F. Burton
found, from the census returns of 1859 for the town of São João d’El
Rei, where there is a large intermixture of the white race with the
coloured women, an excess of nearly 50 per cent. of women as compared
with men.[3012] A census of the population in the Province of Rio,
taken in the year 1844, also shows a considerable excess of women, not
only, however, among the mixed population, but among the Indian and
negro creoles as well;[3013] and M. de Castelnau was astonished at the
disproportionately large number of females in Goyaz.[3014]

In the northern parts of the United States, according to Kohl, female
children predominate in the families of the cross-breeds arising from
the intercourse of Frenchmen with Indian women.[3015] This statement
is very much like Graf v. Görtz’s, that the families of the offspring
of Dutchmen and Malay women in Java (Lipplapps) consist chiefly of
daughters.[3016] A census taken in the eighteenth century, given by
Süssmilch, proves also that among these mongrels there is a great
excess of women over men.[3017] From Stanley Pool in Congo, Dr. Sims
writes to me, “It is the subject of general remark here, that the
half-caste children are generally girls; out of ten I can count, two
only are boys.” At the same time he states that, among the native
Bateke people, no disproportion between the sexes is observable. Mr.
Cousins informs me that, in the western province of Cis-Natalian
Kafirland, in the “Karoo” district from Caledon up to Mossel Bay,
there is a half-caste or mixed race called “Bruin Menschen,” generally
known as bastards, among whom more females than males are born. Dr.
Felkin found that, among the foreign women imported to Uganda, the
excess of females in the first births was enormous, _viz._, 510 females
to 100 males, as compared with 102 females to 100 males in first births
from pure Waganda women; whilst in subsequent pregnancies of these
imported women the ratio was 137 females to 100 males. As a matter of
fact, in the families of the poorer classes of Uganda, who “do all
in their power to marry pure Waganda women,” the sexes are as evenly
balanced as in Europe, whereas this is certainly not the case among
the children of chiefs and wealthy men who have large harems supplied
mainly with foreign wives. “I found,” says Dr. Felkin, “that of the
women captured by the slave-raiders in Central Africa, and brought down
to the East Coast, either near Zanzibar or through the Soudan to the
Red Sea, those who had been impregnated on the way usually produced
female children. Hence the Soudan slave-dealers, instead of having only
one slave to sell, have a woman and a female child.”[3018] Dr. Felkin
suggests, as an explanation of this excess of female births, that the
temporarily superior parent produces the opposite sex; but the facts
stated seem strongly to corroborate the theory that intermixture of
race is in favour of female births. Very remarkable are two statements
in the Talmud, that mixed marriages produce only girls.[3019] Mr.
Jacobs informs me that his collection of Jewish statistics includes
details of 118 mixed marriages; of these 28 are sterile, and in the
remainder there are 145 female children and 122 male—that is, 118·82 to
100 males.

We must not, of course, take for granted that what applies to certain
races of men holds good for all of them; but it should be observed that
the cases mentioned refer to mongrels of very different kinds. It is
indeed scarcely probable that anything else than the crossing can be
the cause of this excess of females, as facts tend to show that unions
between related individuals or, generally, between individuals who are
very like each other, produce a comparatively great number of male
offspring.

In all the in-and-in bred stocks of the Bates herd at Kirklevington,
according to Mr. Bell, the number of bull calves was constantly very
far in excess of the heifers.[3020] Of the in-and-in bred Warlaby
branch of short-horns, Mr. Carr says that it “appears to have a most
destructive propensity to breed bulls.”[3021] Dr. Goehlert’s statement
as regards horses, just referred to, is corroborated by Crampe’s
investigations, which included more than two thousand different cases,
all tending to prove that female foals predominate in proportion as the
parent animals differ in colour.[3022]

We have seen that the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills are probably the
most in-and-in bred people of whom anything is known, and we have
also seen how, among them, the disproportion between male and female
births is strikingly in favour of the males. Among the Badagas, a
neighbouring people, who, like the Todas, have numerous subdivisions
of caste, each of which differs in some social or ceremonial
custom,[3023] and all of which, probably, are endogamous, there is also
a considerable surplus of men.[3024] Now it is very remarkable that
in another tribe inhabiting the same hill ranges, the Kotars, who do
not intermarry with the inhabitants of their own village, but always
seek a wife from another “kotagiri,” women are not so scarce as among
the Todas and the Badagas.[3025] Among the endogamous Maoris, the
men outnumber the women. So also among the Sinhalese, who consider
marriage between the father’s sister’s son and the mother’s brother’s
daughter the most proper union. Among the polyandrous Arabs mentioned
by Strabo, marriage between cousins was the rule. The polyandrous
mountaineer of South Africa, in almost every case, marries a daughter
of his father’s brother.[3026] And with the Jews, among whom cousin
marriages occur perhaps three times as often as among the surrounding
populations,[3027] the proportion of births is probably more in favour
of the males than among the non-Jewish population of Europe.[3028]
All these facts, taken together, seem to render it probable that
the degree of differentiation in the sexual elements of the parents
exercises some influence upon the sex of the offspring, so that, when
the differentiation is unusually great, the births are in favour of
females; when it is unusually small, in favour of males.

We certainly cannot, from the numerical proportion of the sexes,
especially at birth, draw any inference as to the form of marriage
characteristic of the species. Among birds living in a state of nature,
polyandry is almost unheard of, though, according to Dr. Brehm, the
males are generally more numerous than the females.[3029] As for
man, there are several non-polyandrous peoples among whom the men
are considerably in excess of the women; whilst among other peoples
polygyny is forbidden, though the women are in excess of the men.
Nevertheless, the form of marriage depends to a great extent upon
the proportion between the male and female population. Polyandry, as
already said, is due chiefly to a surplus of men, though it prevails
only where the circumstances are otherwise in favour of it. And, as
regards polygyny, I cannot agree with M. Chervin that it is quite
independent of the proportion between the sexes.[3030] It has been
observed that, in India, polyandry occurs in those parts of the country
where the males outnumber the females, polygyny in those where the
reverse is the case.[3031] Indeed, in countries unaffected by European
civilization, polygyny seems to prevail wherever women form the
majority.

Thus the causes which determine the proportion of the sexes exercise
some influence also upon the form of marriage. Among the Eskimo, for
instance, who, according to Armstrong, take more than one wife when
the women are sufficiently numerous,[3032] polygyny results chiefly
from the dangerous life the men have to lead in order to gain their
subsistence. Among the Indians of North America, it is, to a large
extent, due to the wars which destroy many of the male population. In
certain countries it seems to be furthered by physiological conditions
leading to an excess of female births. As for polyandry, we have some
reason to believe that it is due, on the one hand, to poor conditions
of life, on the other to close intermarrying. As a matter of fact, the
chief polyandrous peoples either live in sterile mountain regions, or
are endogamous in a very high degree.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are several reasons why a man may desire to possess more than
one wife. First, monogamy requires from him periodical continence. He
has to live apart from his wife, not only for a certain time every
month,[3033] but, among many peoples, during her pregnancy also.[3034]
Among the Shawanese, for instance, “as soon as a wife is announced to
be in a state of pregnancy, the matrimonial rights are suspended, and
continency preserved with a religious and mystical scrupulosity.”[3035]
This suspension of matrimonial rights is usually continued till a
considerable time after child-birth. Among the Northern Indians, a
mother has to remain in a small tent placed at a little distance from
the others during a month or five weeks;[3036] and similar customs
are found among many other peoples.[3037] Very commonly, in a state
of savage and barbarous life, the husband must not cohabit with his
wife till the child is weaned.[3038] And this prohibition is all the
more severe, as the suckling-time generally lasts for two, three,
four years, or even more. In Sierra Leone, it was looked upon as a
crime of the most heinous nature if a wife cohabited with her husband
before the child was able to run alone.[3039] Among the Makonde, in
Eastern Africa, says Mr. Joseph Thomson, “when a woman bears a child,
she lives completely apart from her husband till the child is able to
speak, as otherwise it is believed that harm, if not death, would come
to the infant.”[3040] In Fiji, “the relatives of a woman take it as a
public insult if any child should be born before the customary three or
four years have elapsed.”[3041] This long suckling-time is due chiefly
to want of soft food and animal milk.[3042] But when milk can be
obtained,[3043] and even when the people have domesticated animals able
to supply them with it,[3044] this kind of food is often avoided. The
Chinese, who are a Tartar people, and must have descended at one time
from the “Land of Grass,” entirely eschew the use of milk.[3045]

Professor Bastian suggests that it is on hygienic grounds, though
almost instinctively, that a man abstains from cohabitation with his
wife during her pregnancy, and as long as she suckles her child.[3046]
But the reason seems rather to be of a religious character. Diseases
are generally attributed by savages to the influence of some evil
spirit.[3047] Among many peoples the attainment of the age of puberty
is marked by most superstitious ceremonies.[3048] A woman, during the
time of menstruation, is looked upon with a mystic detestation.[3049]
It is therefore quite in accordance with primitive ideas that the
appearance of a new being should be connected in some way with
supernatural agencies. Among the Ashantees, according to Mr. Reade,
“when conception becomes apparent, the girl goes through a ceremony
of abuse, and is pelted down to the sea, where she is cleansed. She is
then set aside; charms are bound on her wrists, spells are muttered
over her, and, by a wise sanitary regulation, her husband is not
allowed to cohabit with her from that time until she has finished
nursing her child.”[3050] A woman in child-bed is very commonly
considered unclean.[3051] In China, a man of the upper classes does not
speak to his wife within the first month after the birth of a child,
and no visitor will enter the house where she lives.[3052] According to
early Aryan traditions, as v. Żmigrodzki remarks, a witch and a woman
in child-bed are persons so intimately connected, that it is impossible
to make any distinction between them.[3053]

One of the chief causes of polygyny is the attraction which female
youth and beauty exercise upon man. Several instances have already
been mentioned of a fresh wife being taken when the first wife grows
old. Indeed, when a man, soon after he has attained manhood, marries
a woman of similar age—not to speak of such countries as China and
Corea, where the first wife is generally a woman from three to eight
years older than her husband[3054]—he will still be a man in the prime
of life, when the youthful beauty of his wife has passed away for
ever. This is especially the case among peoples at the lower stages of
civilization, among whom, as a rule, women get old much sooner than in
more advanced communities.

Thus in California, according to Mr. Powers, women are rather handsome
in their free and untoiling youth, but after twenty-five or thirty they
break down under their heavy burdens and become ugly.[3055] Among the
Mandans, the beauty of the women vanishes soon after marriage.[3056]
The Kutchin women get “coarse and ugly as they grow old, owing to
hard labour and bad treatment.”[3057] Patagonian women are said to
lose their youth at a very early age, “from exposure and hard work;”
and among the Warraus, according to Schomburgk, “when the woman has
reached her twentieth year, the flower of her life is gone.”[3058]
In New Zealand, Tahiti, Hawaii, and other islands of the South Sea,
the beauty of women soon decays—“the result,” says Mr. Angas, “of
hard labour in some cases, and in others of early intercourse with
the opposite sex, combined with their mode of living, which rapidly
destroys their youthful appearance.”[3059]

“Women of fifty in Europe,” Stavorinus observes, “look younger and
fresher than those of thirty in Batavia.”[3060] At two and twenty,
Dyak beauty “has already begun to fade, and the subsequent decay is
rapid.”[3061] Among the Manipuris and Garos, the women, pretty when
young, soon become “hags”;[3062] and this is true also of the Aino
women in Yesso, partly, it is said, because of the exposed life they
lead as children, partly because of the early age at which they marry
and become mothers, and partly because of the hard life they continue
to lead afterwards.[3063]

In Africa female beauty fades quickly. The Egyptian women, from the age
of about fourteen to that of eighteen or twenty, are generally models
of loveliness in body and limbs, but, when they reach maturity, their
attractions do not long survive.[3064] In Eastern Africa, according
to Sir R. F. Burton, the beauty of women is less perishable than in
India and Arabia; but even there charms are on the wane at thirty, and,
when old age comes on, the women are no exceptions to “the hideous
decrepitude of the East.”[3065] Arab girls in the Sahara preserve
only till about their sixteenth year that youthful freshness which
the women of the north still possess in the late spring of their
life;[3066] and, among the Ba-kwileh, women have no trace of beauty
after twenty-five.[3067] Speaking of the Wolofs, Mr. Reade remarks that
the girls are very pretty with their soft and glossy black skin, but,
“when the first jet of youth is passed, the skin turns to a dirty
yellow and creases like old leather; their eyes sink into the skull,
and the breasts hang down like the udder of a cow, or shrivel up like a
bladder that has burst.”[3068] Among the Damaras, Ovambo, and Kafirs,
women, soon after maturity, begin to wither, as we are told, on account
of hard labour;[3069] and the Bushman women, it is said, soon become
sterile from the same cause.[3070] Among the Fulah, it is rare for a
woman older than twenty to become a mother; and in Unyoro Emin Pasha
never saw a woman above twenty-five with babies.[3071]

Early intercourse with the opposite sex is adduced by several writers
as the cause of the short prime of savage women. But I am disposed to
think that physical exertion has a much greater influence. Even from a
physiological point of view hard labour seems to shorten female youth.
Statistics show that, among the poorer women of Berlin, menstruation
ceases at a rather earlier age than among the well-off classes.[3072]
It has been suggested that in hot countries women lose their beauty
much sooner than in colder regions,[3073] whereas men are not affected
in the same way by climate. But, so far as I know, we are still in want
of exact information on this point.

A further cause of polygyny is man’s taste for variety. Merolla da
Sorrento asserts that the Negroes of Angola, who used to exchange their
wives with each other for a certain time, excused themselves, when
reproved, on the ground that “they were not able to eat always of the
same dish.”[3074] And in Egypt, according to Mr. Lane, “fickle passion
is the most evident and common motive both to polygamy and repeated
divorces.”[3075]

Motives due to man’s passions are not, however, the only causes of
polygyny. We must also take into account his desire for offspring,
wealth, and authority.

The barrenness of a wife is a very common reason for the choice of
another partner. Among the Greenlanders, for instance, who considered
it a great disgrace for a man to have no children, particularly no
sons, a husband generally took a second wife, if the first one could
not satisfy his desire for offspring.[3076] Among the Botis of Ladakh,
says Lieutenant Cunningham, “should a wife prove barren, a second can
be chosen, or should she have daughters only, a second can be chosen
similarly.”[3077] In the Mutsa tribe of Indo-China, polygyny is allowed
only if the wife is sterile;[3078] and, among the Patuah or Juanga,
the Eskimo at Prince Regent’s Bay, and several other peoples, already
referred to, a man scarcely ever takes a second wife if the first wife
gives him children.[3079] Among the Tuski, “if a man’s wife bears only
girls, he takes another until he obtains a boy, but no more.”[3080]
In China and Tonquin, and among the Munda Kols of Chota Nagpore, it
sometimes happens that the barren wife herself advises her husband to
take a fresh partner,[3081] as Rachel gave Jacob Bilhah.[3082]

The polygyny of the ancient Hindus seems to have been due chiefly to
the fact that men dreaded the idea of dying childless, and M. Le Play
observes that even now in the East the desire for offspring is one of
the principal causes of polygyny.[3083] Dr. Gray makes the same remark
as to the Chinese,[3084] Herr Andree as to the Jews.[3085] In Egypt,
says Mr. Lane, “a man having a wife who has the misfortune to be
barren, and being too much attached to her to divorce her, is sometimes
induced to take a second wife, merely in the hope of obtaining
offspring.”[3086]

The more wives, the more children; and the more children, the
greater power. Man in a savage and barbarous state is proud of a
large progeny, and he who has most kinsfolk is most honoured and
feared.[3087] Regarding certain Indians of North America, among whom
the dignity of chief was elective, Heriot remarks that “the choice
usually fell upon him who had the most numerous offspring, and who
was therefore considered as the person most deeply interested in the
welfare of the tribe.”[3088] Among the Chippewas, says Mr. Keating,
“the pride and honour of parents depend upon the extent of their
family.”[3089] Speaking of African polygyny, Sir R. F. Burton observes
that the “culture of the marriage tie is necessary among savages and
barbarians, where, unlike Europe, a man’s relations and connections are
his only friends; besides which, a multitude of wives ministers to his
pride and influence, state and pleasure.”[3090] Bosman tells us of a
viceroy tributary to the negro king of Fida, who, assisted only by his
sons and grandsons with their slaves, repulsed a powerful enemy who
came against him. This viceroy, with his sons and grandsons, could make
out the number of two thousand descendants, not reckoning daughters or
any that were dead.[3091] Moreover, in a state of nature, next to a
man’s wives, the real servant, the only one to be counted upon, is the
child.[3092]

A husband’s desire for children often leads to polygyny in countries
where the fecundity of women is at a low rate. More than a hundred
years ago, Dr. Hewit observed that women are naturally less prolific
among rude than among polished nations.[3093] This assertion, though
not true universally,[3094] is probably true in the main. “It
is a very rare occurrence for an Indian woman,” says Mr. Catlin,
“to be ‘blessed’ with more than four or five children during her
life; and, generally speaking, they seem contented with two or
three.”[3095] This statement is confirmed by the evidence of several
other authorities;[3096] and it holds good not only for the North
American Indians, but, upon the whole, for a great many uncivilized
peoples.[3097] Some writers ascribe this slight degree of prolificness
to hard labour,[3098] or to unfavourable conditions of life in
general.[3099] That it is partly due to the long period of suckling is
highly probable, not only because a woman less eas
