PREFACE


This book contains more than one thousand facts, many of which are not
generally known to the average person; but all of them are of interest
to humankind, and a knowledge of many of them is essential.

The author has used the simplest English, and has avoided, as far as
possible, all technical or scientific terms. He has endeavored not
to fall into the common error of making his explanations harder to
understand than the subjects treated.

This book is not intended for the scientist, nor does it claim to be
exhaustive.

In the space of a few hundred pages the writer has presented the
thousand or more things which are really worth knowing, and which are
usually described at unprofitable length and without that simplicity of
expression so essential to clearness.

=Acetylene Gas.=--Acetylene gas is used largely for the search-lamps on
automobiles. It is composed of carbon and hydrogen.


=Adventists.=--A religious sect whose members believe that the second
coming of Christ is near at hand. There are over 100,000 communicants
and ministers.

=Æolian Harp.=--This instrument was invented in the 17th century and
was named after Æolus, the god of the winds. It is of the simplest
construction, and its music is produced by the vibration of the strings
automatically moved by the winds. In construction it is a rectangular
box of thin boards of a few inches in depth and width and of sufficient
length to extend across a window so that the breeze may pass through
it. The strings are stretched lengthwise across the top of the box, and
may be tuned by increasing or decreasing their tension.


=Age.=--About 50 per cent. of the persons living in the United States
are under 20 years of age, 45 per cent. from 20 to 60 years, and 5 per
cent. over 60 years, the average age being about 25 years. This average
seems low, and is due largely to infant mortality. If the percentage
was taken excluding those under 15 years of age it would be very much
higher.


=Agricultural Implement Industry.=--Capital invested, about
$260,000,000, and an annual output of about $150,000,000. About 60,000
people are employed.


=Alaska.=--Alaska is the only territory of the United States, the
Hawaiian Islands, Porto Rico, and the Philippines being known as
Possessions. It has an area of over 590,000 square miles, and a
population of about 65,000. Its climate is semipolar.

=Algebra.=--The discoverer or the first user of algebra is unknown. It
is said that Diophantus wrote it in 170 A. D., and he may have been its
inventor. It was brought into Spain in about 900. Its signs are said to
have been used first in 1544, but algebra did not come into common use
until 1590. Descartes applied algebra to geometry in 1637.


=Almanacs.=--The word "almanac" is of Saxon origin, and probably the
first almanac was published in 1470, and the first in English in 1673.


=Amazons.=--An ancient body of warlike women, ruled by a queen, who
allowed no man to live with them. They were opposed to marriage and
resolved to form a female state. They burned off their right breasts
that they might better use the bow and javelin. This custom is the
origin of the name "Amazons" or "breastless ones."


=Apostles' Creed.=--Considered by most Biblical students as the
earliest form of Christian creed. It is attributed directly to the
Apostles. It is doubtless the formula of belief that existed in all
the early Latin churches. It was made a part of public worship of the
Christian church at Antioch, and introduced into the Roman Catholic
Church in the eleventh century, and subsequently into the Church of
England.


=April Fool's Day.=--Its origin is unknown, but it is supposed to
follow an ancient pageant custom of playing tricks on the first day of
April.


=Arbor Day.=--A few years ago the United States and Canada officially
set apart one day in the year for the planting of trees, shrubs, etc.
It was the intention to have this day observed chiefly by the children
of the public schools. Its observance has resulted in the planting of
millions of trees.


=Arithmetic.=--While the inventor or discoverer of arithmetic is
unknown, it is said that it was brought from Egypt into Greece in 600
B. C. Euclid is the author of the oldest treatise upon arithmetic and
wrote it about 300 B. C. The arithmetic of decimals began in 1482, and
the first arithmetic in English was printed in 1522.


=Artesian Wells.=--An artesian well is one made by boring
perpendicularly into the earth. The oldest known well of this kind was
sunk in Europe in 1126. Probably the most famous one is near Paris,
which was bored in 1833, bringing water from a depth of 1792 feet.
From this well 516 gallons of water flow per minute. In Missouri there
is one well 2197 feet deep, and another nearly 4000 feet deep. The
invention of the artesian well is undoubtedly due to the Chinese.


=Artificial Ice.=--The artificial manufacture of ice is of somewhat
recent origin, and there are over 2,000 ice-making plants in the
United States, exclusive of those used by breweries, packers, and
others for the making of their own ice. Artificial ice-making showed an
increase of 81 per cent. during the last few years.


=Atlantic Cable.=--The original or, rather, the first permanent cable,
was laid in July, 1866, connecting Ireland with Newfoundland; but an
earlier cable was laid between the foregoing points, which was lost in
construction. This lost cable, however, was recovered and completed.

In 1868 a cable was laid from France to Duxbury, Mass. In 1873 the
fourth Atlantic cable connected Ireland and Trinity Bay, New Foundland.
Several cables have been subsequently laid, and are maintained.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining the right kind,
and a sufficient current, of electricity, which would carry the message
several thousand miles under water, and not pass from the cable into
the water itself.

Two keys are used, which, when depressed, transmit respectively
positive and negative currents coming from the connected batteries. The
current does not pass directly into the cable, but enters what is known
as a condenser, and from there reaches the wire itself. This increases
the force of the current and overcomes interfering earth currents.

Originally the messages were received by a reflecting galvanometer.
Upon the magnet of this instrument was placed a small curved mirror,
and in front of it was a lighted lamp behind a frame with a vertical
slit. The light from the lamp passed through the slit and fell upon
the surface of the mirror. The flashes of light moving with the
movements of the suspended needle, indicated the message sent. Because
of the delicacy of the instrument, it was difficult to translate the
telegraphic code. The system has been entirely superseded by the use of
the syphon galvanometer. This needle is affected by the currents, and
moves in response to the opening and closing of the telegraphic key.
It consists of a small hollow needle, which swings between two fixed
magnets. A very soluble analine ink is allowed to flow through the
tube. The mouth of this tube is suspended a very small fraction above a
strip or roll of white paper, which moves automatically. The vibration
or movements of the needle allow the ink to flow in irregular lines or
curves upon the moving paper. These irregularities or curves indicate
letters, which are easily read by the receiving operator.

Cable dispatches now are recorded, when formerly they had to be read as
they were seen, with the impossibility of retaining an automatic record
of them.

Professor Morse, the inventor of telegraphy, may be considered
the inventor of the cable, although he had little to do with its
mechanical construction. To Mr. Cyrus W. Field must be given much of
the credit, for its accomplishment was largely due to his foresight and
energy.

The cable consists of several copper wires imbedded in gutta percha
or similar substance, which is one of the best nonconductors of
electricity. The cable, with its several wires and coverings or
insulation, has a circumference equal to that of the old-fashioned
three-cent piece. Several wires are imbedded into the insulation, so as
to insure better connection.

The cable is laid by steamers built for the purpose. They travel over
a charted route, and, unscientifically speaking, throw the cable
overboard. Of course, no cable could be constructed of a length that
would reach across the ocean. New pieces are, therefore, spliced in
as conditions require. If the sea is too rough for the laying of the
cable, the end is buoyed and picked up when the weather changes. The
cable lies upon the bottom of the ocean, and, as the bottom of the
ocean is as irregular as the surface of the earth, with its mountains,
plateaus, and valleys, there is always danger of the cable being
broken or injured, although there is, of course, absolute quiet at the
bottom of the ocean. Then, many feet, or even a mile, of cable may be
stretched between two projecting points, and the strain may part it in
time.

The process of locating a break or injury is very interesting. The
cable fails to work. The operator stationed at either end discharges
electricity into the cable, and, although it does not reach the other
side, he can, by a delicate instrument, locate approximately the place
of parting or where injury has occurred. The repair steamer sails for
the place. With grappling irons it brings the cable to the surface;
but as the location of the break cannot be determined accurately, the
electrician on board must determine which way to sail to locate the
place of the trouble. He attaches the cable to a battery on board,
and opens connection with the land. If the break, for example, is
between him and Europe, the European operator will not respond, but he
will receive a reply from the American operator. He then directs the
vessel's course towards Europe. The cable, when it is taken on board,
is run on pulley wheels, one in the bow and one in the stern of the
vessel, and the vessel sails slowly under the cable. As the vessel is
two or three hundred feet long, several hundred feet of cable will be
exposed. The cable is watched carefully, and the break or injury will
be easily located. When it is, the operator connects the cable with the
batteries, and then telegraphs in the direction opposite to that from
which he received a reply. If his message goes through, the receiving
operator will respond. If a reply comes, he knows he has located the
break; if no reply is received, there must be other breaks in the same
direction. The break is repaired, and the steamer sails on until it
finds another break or injury. I have attempted to explain this in the
simplest words. It is obvious that a scientific explanation would be
unintelligible to the average reader.


=Atmosphere.=--While accurate figures are impossible, and while
astronomers somewhat differ, it is generally conceded that the earth's
atmosphere extends from the surface to an altitude of about 40 miles.
It is theoretically or scientifically accepted that the density of the
atmosphere at only a few miles from the surface of the earth is not
sufficient to support life.


=Aurora Borealis.=--Until electricity was discovered, the origin of the
aurora borealis was unknown, and was supposed to be of supernatural
origin. Even to-day its exact composition or source is more or less
of a mystery, but it is generally supposed that it is caused by the
recomposition of positive and negative electricity. It exists only in
the regions of the poles, although its light is seen to a moderate
degree over the greater part of the earth.


=Automobiles.=--All vehicles used on the common highway, and propelled
by any mechanical power, whether it be by steam, gasoline, or
electricity, are known as automobiles or motor cars, and are frequently
called "autos" for short. The invention of the automobile is very
recent, although steam-propelled carriages were in existence more than
50 years ago. Exceeding a million are in daily use in the United States.


=Bank of England.=--Established in the city of London in 1694.
Although a private institution, it is under Government control, and
constitutes the Treasury of the Empire, England having no national
treasury like that of the United States. It is managed by a governor,
deputy-governor, and twenty-four directors.


=Bastile.=--The name given to a French prison, built between 1370 and
1383, originally as a fortress, but later used as a regular prison.
It was destroyed by a mob in 1789. It was the seat of the terrible
cruelties practiced in the early days.


=Bayreuth Festival.=--A musical festival held at the National Theatre
in Bayreuth, Bavaria, which was built for the performance of the works
of Wagner. The foundation stone of the building was laid in 1872, and
Wagner himself opened the theatre in 1876 with a grand production of
the "Nibelungen Trilogy."


=Bible.=--Between the eighth and tenth centuries parts of the Bible
were translated into Anglo-Saxon, and in 1290 appeared an English
version of the Psalms. In 1380 the New Testament was finished, and a
little later the Old Testament was fully translated. The so-called King
James Bible was published in 1610, and remained in common use until the
present revisions were made.

=Blind.=--In the United States there are about 65,000 blind persons, a
little more than half of whom are totally blind. Of this number about
37,000 are males, and about 28,000 females.


=Blood-heat.=--The normal temperature of man is about 98-1/2°
Fahrenheit. This temperature is maintained with a variation of not more
than two degrees, whether one lives on the Equator or in the Arctic
regions. Any great deviation is likely to prove fatal. Animals have
about the same temperature as man, while the blood of birds is from
eight to ten degrees warmer. Reptiles, fishes, and all invertebrates
maintain temperatures about the same as that of their environment.


=Blue-Grass Region.=--An undulating plateau in the north-central
part of Kentucky, covering about 10,000 square miles, is known as
the Blue-Grass Region. The underlying rock for 150 or more feet is
blue limestone, very rich in phosphate of lime. This rock crumbles
on exposure to the air and enriches the soil. Tobacco and hemp have
two crops a year and grow to a great height. Meadow grass grows
continuously. The Blue-Grass Region for many years has been the centre
of the blooded stock of America.


=Boxers.=--A Chinese secret society supposed to be semireligious and
semipatriotic. The Boxers originally believed that they were immune
from death or physical injury, and that they could, with safety, attack
any foreign foe.


=Brain.=--As the action of the brain has not, as yet, been seen by man,
no one, at the present day, knows just what it is, beyond its merely
physiological or mechanical substance. It is said that the brain of the
normal man contains over 300,000,000 cells, and that about 3,000 are
destroyed every minute. If this is the case, then a new brain appears
once in 60 days. The normal brain has a volume of from 58 to 105 cubic
inches. The brain of the Anglo-Saxon and German, and of other civilized
nations, averages the larger number, while the negro brain occupies a
space of about 96 cubic inches, and some Australian natives have brains
of only about 58 cubic inches. The male brain is about ten per cent.
heavier or larger than that of the female. The most intelligent animals
have only about 16 ounces of brains. The size of the brain, if it is
not below normal, does not appear to influence the intellectuality of
its possessor. Men with small brains may have larger mind capacity
than some of those possessing brains weighing several ounces more. It
would appear, then, that the size of the brain, unless it be unusually
small, has little to do with its quality.


=Bread.=--It is said that the Chinese were the first bread makers,
and that they made bread from wheat and rice as early as 1998 B. C.
Probably the first bread made from yeast was baked in England in about
1634. Aërated bread, which rises from carbolic acid gas injected into
the dough, became somewhat common in 1857, but practically all bread,
bakery-made or home-made, owes its leavening to yeast or baking powder.


=Breakfast Foods.=--Breakfast foods in the main are composed of either
corn, wheat, or oat products, a few being made of barley, starch, and
tapioca. They are sold under trade names, and most of them need no
cooking by the consumer, as they were properly cooked at the mill.
Usually they are made of only one grain, and to some of them is added
a small quantity of salt. Most of them are pure products and are
unadulterated, but few, if any of them, are any better than the grain
sold in bulk, which can be purchased for about 4 cents per pound.


=Brook Farm.=--A famous socialistic community, originated by George
Ripley and others in 1841 and located near West Roxbury, Massachusetts.
The estate consisted of two hundred acres, and a company of educated
men and women settled here to work out an experiment, in which each
person performed a certain share of necessary manual labor. The
enterprise was abandoned as an utter failure in 1846. Among the persons
connected with the movement were George Ripley, Charles A. Dana, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, George William Curtis, Theodore
Parker, Margaret Fuller, and Dr. Channing.


Calculating Interest

To find the interest on any sum, at any rate per cent., and for any
length of time: 1st. Multiply the principal by the rate per cent.,
expressed in hundredths; this will give the interest for one year.
2nd. Find the number of days remaining by consulting the calendar; and
multiply the principal by as many hundredths as there are days, and for
3 per cent., divide the product by 120; for 4 per cent., divide by 90;
for 5 per cent., divide by 72; for 6 per cent., divide by 60; for 7 per
cent., divide by 52; for 8 per cent., divide by 45; for 9 per cent.,
divide by 40; for 10 per cent., divide by 36; and for 12 per cent.,
divide by 30. This will give the interest for the days. 3rd. Add the
two items of interest, and the sum will be the entire interest.

To find the number of days from any day of any one month to the same
day of any other month.

=Canals.=--The Suez Canal is 90 miles long with a depth of 35 feet, and
is 108 feet wide at the bottom. It cost $100,000,000. The Manchester
Canal, between Manchester and Liverpool, is 35-1/2 miles long, with a
depth of 28 feet, and 120 feet wide at the bottom. It cost $85,000,000.
The canal connecting the Baltic and North Seas is 61 miles long, 29-1/2
feet deep, and has a bottom width of 72 feet. It cost $40,000,000.
The Panama Canal, which is not yet completed, will be about 50 miles
in length, with a width of 300 feet, and a minimum depth of 41 feet.
The United States Government paid $50,000,000 to the new French Canal
Company and the Republic of Panama, for property rights and franchises,
and the total cost of the canal will not be far from $375,000,000. At
the present time nearly 50,000 men are at work upon the canal, and the
official opening is announced for January 1, 1915. When completed, it
will be the largest work of its class in the world, although not the
longest canal.


=Capacity of Cisterns or Wells.=--For each ten inches in depth, a
cistern 2 feet in diameter will hold 19 gallons; 2-1/2 ft., 30 g.; 3
ft., 44 g.; 3-1/2 ft., 60 g.; 4 ft., 78 g.; 4-1/2 ft., 97 g.; 5 ft.,

3059 g.


=Capitol at Washington.=--The Capitol is situated in latitude 38° 53´
20´´.4 north and longitude 77° 00´ 35´´.7 west from Greenwich. It
fronts east, and stands on a plateau eighty-eight feet above the level
of the Potomac. The entire length of the building from north to south
is 751 feet 4 inches, and its greatest dimension from east to west 350
feet. The area covered by the building is 153,112 square feet. The dome
of the original central building was constructed of wood, covered with
copper. This was replaced in 1856 by the present structure of cast
iron. The entire weight of iron used is 8,909,200 pounds. The dome is
crowned by a bronze statue of Freedom, which is nineteen feet, six
inches, high and weighs 14,985 pounds. The height of the dome above
the base line of the east front is 287 feet 5 inches. The height from
the top of the balustrade of the building is 217 feet 11 inches. The
greatest diameter at the base is 135 feet 5 inches. The rotunda is 97
feet 6 inches in diameter, and its height from the floor to the top
of the canopy is 217 feet 3 inches. The Senate Chamber is 113 feet 3
inches in length, 83 feet 3 inches in width, and 36 feet in height. The
galleries will accommodate 1,000 persons. The Representatives' Hall is
139 feet in length, by 93 feet in width, and 36 feet in height. The
room now occupied by the Supreme Court was, until 1859, the Senate
Chamber. Previous to that time the court occupied the room immediately
beneath, now used as a law library.


=Celluloid.=--Celluloid, from which many toilet articles and imitations
of ivory are made, is composed from the cellulose found in cotton cloth
or raw cotton. It is treated with a solution of nitric acid which forms
it into a pulp very much like paper pulp. It is then washed with water,
which removes most of the acid. It is partially hardened and camphor
gum mixed with it, when it is rolled into sheets and thoroughly dried.
In order to manipulate it, it is softened by steam and then hardened by
drying. Celluloid is very inflammable. Wearers of celluloid combs and
other ornaments should not expose themselves to fire.


=Certified Checks.=--A personal check becomes certified when across it
is written "certified," with the name of the bank and the signature of
the cashier or other official. The bank, then, becomes liable for the
amount of the check. If the maker of a check has his check certified,
he is jointly responsible with the bank for its payment, but if the
receiver of the check has it certified, the maker of the check is
released from all responsibility.


Chemical Composition of Man

Huxley's table on the chemical composition of man of the average weight
of 154 pounds was for years the standard, but it has recently been
superseded by a new one compiled by the French Academy of Sciences. The
table is appended:

=Chess.=--Chess is one of the oldest, and probably the most scientific,
game known. Its origin is mysterious. It was mentioned in Oriental
literature about 2000 B. C. It was originally played in India, Persia,
and Arabia, and subsequently was known in Spain and Western Europe. It
is said that it was invented in order to teach the art of war.


=Christmas.=--A festival commemorating the birth of Christ. Said
to have been observed as early as 98. Some of the early Christians
celebrated the event in May; others in April and in June. In the fifth
century, it was generally observed on the 25th of December.


=Circulation of the Blood.=--Although even the savage had seen and
spilled blood, the circulation of the blood, and the part that it plays
in the human machine, was not discovered until about 1616, by the
English physiologist, William Harvey.


=Climate and Temperature.=--Climatic conditions are dependent upon
heat, moisture, and altitude. The greatest heat is at the equator and
diminishes as one approaches either pole, but a place of high altitude
near the equator may be cooler than another farther removed from it and
occupying a shut-in or low position. It is warm at times, even near the
poles. The climate is also affected by the winds, and very greatly by
the ocean, and especially by ocean currents. Take England, for example:
it is considerably further north than Boston or New York City, and yet
its climate is much warmer or milder, due to its proximity to the Gulf
Stream. Land near the ocean is likely to be cooler in summer on account
of its prevailing winds, and warmer in winter because a large body of
water reduces the cold. It is well-known that towns on the seashore do
not suffer from extreme cold as much as do those in the same latitude
further inland. The altitude has much to do with climate. Even in
the warmest countries, where the heat is intense, the tops of high
mountains are clothed with snow. Forests, by their shade, reduce the
temperature.


=Coal Industry.=--In the United States the coal fields have an area of
exceeding 160,000 square miles, but it is supposed that there are at
least 310,000 square miles which contain coal. The estimated quantity
of the available coal is exceeding 3,000,000,000,000 tons.


=Cocoa Industry.=--The world produces about 530,000,000 pounds of cocoa
annually. The United States consumes about 130,000,000 pounds; Germany
about 112,000,000; France about 60,000,000; England about 56,000,000;
the total consumption being about 507,000,000.


=Coffee Industry.=--Brazil, about 1,300,000,000, Central America,
about 201,000,000, Venezuela, about 97,000,000, other South American
countries about 78,000,000, Hayti and Santo Domingo, about 84,000,000,
Mexico, about 43,000,000, Porto Rico, about 34,000,000, Jamaica, about
10,000,000; a total of nearly 2,000,000,000 pounds annually. The
United States consumes about 881,000,000 pounds a year.


=Coin.=--Money, in the form of metallic coins, probably superseded all
other legal tenders. The first record of the coining of silver was in
869 B. C., and it was made in Rome as early as 269 B. C., and in Great
Britain 25 years before the Christian Era. Gold was first coined in
England in 1087. Copper money was introduced by James I of England in
1620. The United States mint began to coin money in 1793.


=Colosseum.=--The building of the Colosseum at Rome began in A. D.
80. It covers about five acres of ground, and has a seating capacity
for nearly 90,000 persons. It was built in the form of an oval, with
a diameter varying from 312 to 515 feet, the height being from 160 to
180 feet. In its arena, the gladiators fought among themselves and with
wild beasts. At its dedication by Titus, 5,000 wild beasts were killed,
and the celebration lasted for nearly a hundred days. Occasionally the
arena was flooded with water, and sea fights took place.


=Comets.=--Comets are supposed to be made up of an innumerable number
of meteors, with millions of miles of burning gas. They have regular
orbits, but they have not been fully established and are more or less
eccentric. They are not supposed to shine by their own light, but to
obtain it by reflection. The orbit of comets was discovered by Hadley
in 1682, who predicted their return. Sometimes the head and tail part,
and remain so. Their number is unknown, but there are supposed to be
thousands of them. The comet formerly was looked upon as a source of
danger, and it was supposed that the near approach of one of them
would destroy the earth or any other celestial body. Recent research,
however, indicates that comets have not sufficient density to cause
damage, although they might affect the atmosphere. The principal
thing to be feared, however, if there is any danger, is that the
envelopment of the earth by the comet's gas would destroy life, but
most astronomers have agreed that the atmosphere of the earth would be
sufficient protection. So far as is known, no comet has ever caused
any injury, and as they have existed from time immemorial, there would
appear to be no reason for alarm.

=Communism and Socialism.=--Communism is a doctrine which would
abolish individual rights, including the ownership of property. It
began in England and France, but has never made any great progress.
Socialism is allied to Communism, but is a milder form. It does not
suggest the abolition of individual rights, but to make all rights
subordinate to the good of the people. An acceptable definition of
either has never been presented, and members of both parties differ
materially. Socialism, however, has grown very rapidly, and the
Socialistic Party in the United States is frequently successful. Some
of our ablest scholars and investigators believe that Socialism will
become prevalent, and that in it is vested many of the solutions to our
economic problems.

=Compass.=--The compass was unknown to civilization until the close
of the twelfth century, but there appears to be good authority for
the statement that it was used in China centuries before the European
nations were aware of its power. The compass consists of a piece of
steel, usually in the form of a needle, which has been magnetized so
as to maintain its magnetism indefinitely. It is set on a piece of
cork or rests lightly on a pivot, and if allowed to move freely, it
will point towards the North Magnetic Pole, the opposite end of the
needle indicating the South Magnetic Pole. The needle does not point to
the Geographical Pole, but to the North Magnetic Pole, which is some
degrees south of the former. The earth is a magnet, and the magnetic
needle is influenced by the currents of the earth, and, therefore,
points to the North under the influence of these currents. No compass
is absolutely correct, for the needle does not always point to the
North with a full degree of accuracy. It is subject to variations,
which are caused by outside influences, like the presence of metallic
substances. Without the compass, navigation would be unsafe, if not
impossible, for no mariner, without it, would know the direction he is
sailing in at night or during a cloudy day.


=Corsets.=--The corset, or something similar to what is now worn,
appeared in France and Germany in the 13th century, and a 100 years
later was introduced into England. The cloth was interwoven with rods
of whalebone or steel, but when the price of whalebone increased, other
stiffening rods were used.


=Cosmetics.=--Vaseline, cold cream, and glycerine are perfectly safe to
use, although the latter irritates some skins. Most of the cosmetics
upon the market, including many of those advertised to produce a good
complexion, are practically worthless, and undoubtedly quite a number
of them contain poisonous drugs and chemicals. The writer does not
recall a cosmetic which contains any virtue not found in cold cream,
vaseline, or glycerine. Most cosmetics are made of cold cream or
vaseline, highly perfumed, and are claimed to possess special virtues.
The only way to obtain a good complexion is to keep the skin in a
healthy state by constant bathing and by massage, either with the hands
or with a towel, with a moderate use of cold cream or other similar
article. Nothing has ever been discovered which will restore the bloom
of youth, and all articles advertised for that purpose are practically
worthless. If they contain any "bloom," it is in the form of a dye or
color. No one should use any concoction or salve other than cold cream,
vaseline, glycerine, or an almond preparation, without the advice of a
physician.


=Cost of the British Royal Family.=--The annuities paid by the British
people to the Royal family for its support are as follows: The King
and Queen, $2,350,000; Queen Alexandra, $350,000; Princess Christian,
$30,000; Princess Louise (Duchess of Argyll), $30,000; Duke of
Connaught, $125,000; Duchess of Edinburgh, $30,000; Princess Beatrice,
$30,000; Duchess of Albany, $30,000; Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
$15,000; Trustees for King Edward VII's Daughters, $90,000; total,
$2,790,000. The King also receives the revenues of the Duchy of
Lancaster. During recent years these have amounted to about $350,000
per annum. The Prince of Wales has an income also from the revenues of
the Duchy of Cornwall, amounting to about $500,000 per annum. When the
Royal children marry dowries are usually provided for them. The last
of the children of the late Queen Victoria to marry, Princess Beatrice,
received $150,000 as dowry from the British people by Parliamentary
grant.


=Cotton Gin.=--One of the three or four greatest inventions of
civilization. It was invented by Eli Whitney in 1793. The machine
separates the cotton wool from the seed, and automatically cleans it
with great rapidity. Previously, the work was done by hand, a most
tedious process.


=Cotton Industry.=--From 16,000,000 to 17,000,000 bales of cotton are
sold each year, each bale weighing about 490 lbs.


=Cradle of American Liberty.=--A name given to Faneuil Hall, in Boston,
Massachusetts, from the fact that many meetings were held here during
Revolutionary days for the purpose of declaring the citizens' rights
and protesting against the interference of England.


=Credit Mobilier.=--This consisted of a stock company, organized
in 1863, for the purpose of constructing public works, including
principally the building of the Union Pacific Railroad. Without going
into the merits of the case, it may be said that this organization
received much criticism, as it developed that many of the members of
Congress were supposed to be connected with it. It is said that some of
these members were corrupt and used this organization to feather their
nest. It constituted, perhaps, the greatest national scandal, placing
under suspicion, as it did, many of our so-called statesmen.


=Crusades.=--The name of wars carried on at intervals from 1095 to
1270 by the Christian nations of Europe against the Saracens, for
the purpose of gaining possession of the Holy Land. There were eight
Crusades, and the soldiers who engaged in them wore a cross on their
breast or right shoulder as a sign of their religious faith. Hence the
name Crusades from the Latin _crux_, cross.


=Crust of the Earth.=--Very little is known of the interior of the
earth, except that it is supposed to be a molten mass. The aggregate
thickness of the strata or rock-layers, as far as known, is less than
thirty miles.


=Daguerreotypes.=--Early photography owes its origin to the discovery
of the daguerreotype. A plate, made of thin copper or other metal,
was covered with a silver preparation. This was placed directly in
the camera, and there was no method of transfer, as there is from the
ordinary photographic plate, from which innumerable prints may be
taken. It went out of common use with the invention of the photographic
plates and paper, and with the discovery of instantaneous photography.
The taking of the daguerreotype required long exposure, which was
decidedly objectionable, and the result was coarse and tame. After
taking, the daguerreotype passed through acid solutions for the
development and permanency of the picture.


=Damage by Lightning.=--Statistics vary, but considerably more than
6,000 buildings are injured by lightning every year, causing a loss
of about $3,000,000. About 700 people are killed every year, and more
than 800 are injured. It is said that lightning kills between 4,000 and
5,000 domestic animals a year, valued at about $130,000.


=Deaf and Dumb.=--About 90,000 of the inhabitants of the United States
are deaf and dumb, more than half of that number being born with this
affliction. Of this number about 47,000 are males, and somewhat over
43,000 females.


=Deeds.=--A deed is an instrument in writing, conveying real estate,
with or without buildings upon it, from one party to another. All deeds
should be registered. Printed forms, to be filled out, are for sale at
stationers. It is better to employ a good lawyer or conveyancer.


=Dictionaries.=--Probably the first dictionary was produced in China,
and was said to contain 40,000 characters. In the 15th and 16th
centuries, encyclopedias were published. The first authoritative
dictionary was in Latin, and was translated into eight languages
about the year 1500. Chamber's Encyclopedia was published in 1728,
and Johnson's famous English dictionary in 1755. Webster's American
dictionary was first issued in 1828.


=Digestibility of Foods.=--Apples, sweet, raw, 1 hour, 30 minutes;
Asparagus, boiled, 1 h., 30 m.; Beans, boiled, 2 h., 30 m.; Lean beef,
roasted, 3 h.; Fresh salted beef, boiled 2 h., 45 m.; Old salted beef,

h., 30 m.; Tripe, boiled, 1 h.; Trout, boiled, 1 h., 30 m.; Turkey,
roasted, 2 h., 30 m.; Veal, roast or grilled, 5 h.

=Diving Bells.=--The diving bell is simply a covering made of metal,
which is securely fastened to a water-proof suit, the diving bell
itself being an enclosure for the head. The diver dons his suit, the
neck of which has a collar in the form of a screw. The diving bell is
placed over his head and screwed on. It is connected with a rubber
pipe, through which air is forced by an air pump, the air escaping
through a valve in the belt itself. If properly constructed and
manipulated, one may remain under water for considerable time, although
he is likely to be uncomfortable until he becomes used to it. It was
invented about 1715.


=Drama.=--During 1912, 97 new plays were presented; 36 were musical
comedies; 36 of the plays were serious or sentimental; 13 were
melodramas; 13 were comedies; one was a pantomime; two were tragedies,
and 14 were farces.


=Drugs.=--The safest and best rule to follow is never to take any drug
without the advice of a physician. Drugs have their place, and without
drugs many diseases would be incurable. But drugs taken promiscuously
derange the system and give but temporary relief. Hundreds of thousands
of people have contracted chronic ailments from drug-taking. Headache
powders, cough mixtures, sleeping potions, and practically all of the
advertised remedies should be strenuously avoided, notwithstanding
that some of them are pure and would be efficacious if administered
intelligently. Because one particular drug or medicine benefits a
certain person should not be considered as evidence that it will
aid another. The habit of borrowing prescriptions is dangerous. The
intelligent physician writes a prescription, which will benefit his
patient, and the same prescription would be of no benefit, and might
be of positive injury, to another. Many of the testimonials given
to patent medicines are genuine and are written by honest persons.
The effect of many of the advertised nostrums is to give immediate
or transient relief. They stimulate the system, and may make it feel
better for a short time, but re-action is likely to set in, and the
taker of them is worse off than he was in the first place.

=Dynamite.=--This is one of the strongest explosives, and is used
for blasting, and even for guns, although it has not, as yet, been
successful for the firing of projectiles. It consists of infusorial and
porcelain earth, mixed with coal dust and siliceous ashes, saturated
with about three times its weight of nitro-glycerine. It is of a
grayish-brown or reddish color, damp, and greasy. It has an explosive
power nearly eight times greater than that of gun powder. It is
dangerous to make, because the nitro-glycerine which it contains will
explode if not handled carefully.


Earth Facts

The distance from the surface of the earth to its center is estimated
to be 20,926,202 feet; or about 3,963, miles; and the distance from the
poles to the center of the earth is 20,854,895 feet, or about 3,951
miles. One degree of latitude at the equator is about 68.7 miles, and
at the poles about 69-1/2 miles.

The circumference at the equator measures 24,902 statute miles.

The total area of the earth is 196,940,400 statute square miles, and
its volume is 259,880 million cubic miles.

The land area of the earth covers 54,807,420 square miles.

The ocean, including the inland seas, covers 142,132,980 square miles,
or about 72 per cent. of the total surface of the earth.

The Arctic Ocean, including Hudson Bay, contains 5,785,000 square
miles; the Atlantic Ocean, 34,301,400 square miles; the Indian Ocean,
28,615,000 square miles; the Pacific Ocean, 67,699,630 square miles;
and the Antarctic Ocean, 5,731,350 square miles.

The mean height of the land has been estimated at 2,440 feet, and the
mean depth of the sea 11,470 feet. The highest mountain (Mt. Everest)
is 29,000 feet high, and the greatest depth of the ocean is supposed to
be 31,614 feet.

The North American continent has an area of 6,446,000 square miles,
with exceeding 115,000,000 inhabitants, or a little less than 18 to the
square mile.

The South American continent has an area of 6,837,000 square miles,
with over 45,000,000 inhabitants, or about 6-1/2 per square mile.

Europe has an area of about 3,555,000 square miles, with a population
of somewhat less than 400,000,000, or about 107 per square mile.

Africa has an area of 11,514,000 square miles, and a population of
about 127,000,000, or 11 to the square mile.

Asia has an area of 14,710,000 square miles, with a population
estimated at about 850,000,000, or a little less than 58 to the square
mile.

Australia, New Zealand, and contingent islands, have an area of
3,288,000 square miles, with a population of exceeding 5,200,000, or
about 27 to the square mile.

It is estimated that the surface of the earth is divided into somewhat
more than 28,000,000 square miles of fertile soil, about 14,000,000
square miles of steppe, a little more than 4,000,000 square miles of
desert, with the polar regions occupying nearly 5,000,000 square miles
of land, most of which is covered with ice.

At the time of Emperor Augustus, there were said to be between
54,000,000 and 55,000,000 people upon the earth, but as the earth
undoubtedly supported millions of inhabitants unknown to civilization,
these figures are of little consequence.

The greatest measured depth of the Atlantic Ocean is a little over
27,000 feet; a depth of 30,000 feet has been found in the Pacific
Ocean; 18,582 feet in the Indian Ocean; and 25,200 feet in the Southern
Ocean. Soundings in the Arctic Ocean have failed to find a depth
exceeding 9,000 feet.


=Earthquakes.=--The earthquake is caused, undoubtedly, by the cooling
of the earth. The interior of the earth is a molten mass of fire and is
slowly cooling. As it cools, it contracts, and if the contraction is
near the surface of the earth, the surface is rocked and crevices may
open, doing considerable damage, although most earthquakes cause but
slight shocks and injure no one. Earthquakes appear principally in or
near the tropics, but are occasionally felt all over the temperature
zones. Earthquakes appear to have belts, and there is little to be
feared from them outside of these territories.


Earthquake Areas of the Earth

Major de Montessus de Balore has compiled a catalogue of 130,000
shocks, and this indicates with scientific accuracy how the symptoms
of seismic activity are manifested. The period of observation includes
generally the last fifty years; but there is no reason to suppose that
a longer time would materially affect the proportionate numbers.

  New Zealand                   1,925

The most shaken countries of the world are Italy, Japan, Greece,
South America (the Pacific coast), Java, Sicily, and Asia Minor. The
lands most free from these convulsions are Africa, Australia, Russia,
Siberia, Scandinavia, and Canada. As a rule, where earthquakes are most
frequent they are most severe. But to this general statement there
are exceptions--Indian shocks, though less numerous, being often very
disastrous. Loss of life in many cases depends, however, on density
of population rather than on the intensity of the earth movement.
Numerically, also, France has registered more seismic tremors than
Spain and Portugal, but France in historic times has experienced no
earthquake disaster approaching the havoc wrought by the one calamity
at Lisbon.


=Electrical and Other Beautifiers.=--So far as is known to the writer,
none of these contrivances or concoctions possess any merit, other
than what may be obtained by ordinary massage or rubbing. Electricity,
as a medicinal agent, is rapidly going out of use, as it has been
proved that it has very little effect, except in special cases. The
reader is advised against the purchase of any electrical appliance for
beautifying or other purposes without the advice of a physician.


=Electricity.=--This peculiar and all-powerful energy has never been
analyzed, and no one knows exactly what it is. It is produced by
friction, either mechanically or by chemicals. It is transmitted
through wires or other metallic conductors. Electricity is usually
produced mechanically by what is known as the dynamo, but can be made
chemically by the use of galvanic batteries. The former, however, is
much more economical. Electricity and magnetism are closely allied, and
yet they are commercially different.


=Embezzlement.=--From 1896 to 1911 the total embezzlement in the United
States amounted to nearly $164,000,000, the majority of embezzlers
stealing the money for gambling in stocks, and not on account of
increased personal expenses or desire to live beyond their means.


Errors of History

The following list of "Curious Errors of History" is taken from
Conklin's "Vest Pocket Argument Settler":

William Tell was a myth.

Coriolanus never allowed his mother to intercede for Rome.

Blondel, the harper, did not discover the prison in which Richard I was
confined.

Nero was not a monster; he did not kill his mother nor fiddle over
burning Rome.

Alfred never allowed the cakes to burn, nor ventured into the Danish
camp disguised as a minstrel.

Fair Rosamond was not poisoned by Queen Eleanor, but died in the odor
of sanctity in the convent of Godstow.

The Duke of Wellington, at Waterloo, never uttered the famous words,
"Up, Guards, and at them!"

Charles Kingsley gave up his chair of modern history at Oxford because
he said he considered history "largely a lie."

Chemists have proved that vinegar will not dissolve pearls nor cleave
rocks, in spite of the fabled exploits of Cleopatra and Hannibal.

Charles IX did not fire upon the Huguenots with an arquebus from the
window of the Louvre during the massacre of St. Bartholomew.

The siege of Troy is largely a myth, even according to Homer's own
account. Helen must have been 60 years old when Paris fell in love with
her.

The crew of _Le Vengeur_, instead of going down with the cry of "Vive
la République!" shrieked for help.

The number of Xerxes's army has been grossly exaggerated, and it was
not stopped at Thermopylæ by 300 Spartans, but 7,000, or even, as some
authorities compute, 12,000.

The Abbé Edgeworth frankly acknowledged to Lord Holland that he had
never made the famous invocation to Louis XVI on the scaffold: "Son of
St. Louis, ascend to heaven."

Philip VI, flying from the field of Crécy, and challenged late at
night before the gates of the castle of Blois, did not cry out, "It is
the fortune of France." What he really said was: "Open, open; it is the
unfortunate king of France."

Voltaire, on being asked where he had heard the story that when the
French became masters of Constantinople in 1204 they danced with the
women in the sanctuary of the Church of Santa Sophia, replied calmly:
"Nowhere; it is a frolic of my imagination."

There is no evidence that Romulus ever lived, that Tarquín outraged
Lucretia, that Brutus shammed idiocy and condemned his sons to death,
that Mucius Scaevola thrust his hand into the fire, that Cloelia swam
the Tiber, that Horatius defended a bridge against an army.


=Esperanto.=--Some years ago several educators attempted to develop an
international language, to be used by the speaking and writing world
at large. This auxiliary language is made from the roots of other
languages, including the Latin. Its pronunciation is wholly phonetic.
Theoretically, at least, it has tremendous advantages, for should it
be generally adopted by the civilized nations, who would, undoubtedly,
retain their native language, there would be a common basis for
international communication, and people could get together socially and
otherwise without being linguists. The growth of Esperanto is slow,
although encouraged by many educators. It is problematical whether
or not it will make sufficient strides to be generally accepted. It
has its faults, and it is quite probable that, if an international
language, or auxiliary language, is to be obtained, some other form
of common speech will take its place; or, Esperanto may be changed,
modified, or enlarged, so as to be more acceptable. Civilization,
however, demands a universal language, one which will eventually
take the place of all modern languages, the present languages to be
relegated to the dead class; but natural conditions, association,
and patriotism, or the semblance of them, will, undoubtedly, make
it extremely difficult to introduce any other form of speech, or of
writing, which would interfere with native tongues.


Failures

During 1912, 3,781 manufacturers failed, with liabilities of nearly
$88,500,000. During the same year 10,918 business men or partnership
concerns went into bankruptcy, with liabilities exceeding $90,000,000.
Eighty-four banking houses failed, with liabilities of over
$23,500,000; and 600 brokers and transporters failed, with liabilities
of nearly $24,000,000.

According to the commercial agencies the causes of failures during the
last two years may be tabulated as follows:

  Failures due to        1912     1911

  Incompetence          4,176    3,419
  Inexperience            641      522
  Lack of capital       4,110    3,970
  Unwise credits          281      252
  Extravagance             91      108
  Neglect                 275      277
  Speculation             112       94
  Fraud                 1,423    1,341
  Failures of others      177      171
  Competition             264      360
  Specific conditions   2,262    2,132

The year 1912 stands distinguished from some others years, in that
the excess in failures over the other years is credited to the
increased amount of harm wrought by incompetence and inexperience, two
essentially =personal= faults.

For the first time since the records were compiled in the year 1890,
the percentage ascribed to incompetence stands first in injuriousness
with 30.2 per cent of all failures, as against 29.7 per cent attributed
to lack of capital, hitherto the most hurtful source of trouble, but
which fell from 31.4 in 1911 and 33.9 in 1910.

Incompetency, on the other hand, moved up from 27 per cent in 1911 and
26.6 per cent in 1910 to the figure of 30.2 given above. Inexperience
(without other incompetence) rose to 4.6 per cent in 1912 from 4.1 per
cent in 1911, and these two causes together accounted for the increased
failures; while fraud, the third most important personal cause, fell to
10.3 per cent from 10.6 per cent in 1911.

=First Trans-Atlantic Steamship.=--The "Savannah," a vessel of only
350 tons, and measuring 100 feet, was the first steamship to cross the
Atlantic Ocean. She was launched in New York in 1818. She was propelled
with paddles and ship-rigged. She crossed the Atlantic in 26 days, her
engine being used only 16 days. The rest of the time she was under sail.


=Flour Industry.=--There are nearly 12,000 flour mills in the United
States, requiring a capital of about $350,000,000. These mills use
nearly $770,000,000 worth of material a year, and pay salaries and
wages of about $35,000,000. The annual market value of the flour milled
annually is nearly $900,000,000.


=Food Nutriment.=--On a basis of 1,000 parts, the nutriment value of
foods may be listed as follows:

  Cucumber       25      Cherries      250
  Melons         30      Veal          250
  Turnips        42      Beef          260
  Milk           72      Potatoes      260
  Cabbage        73      Apricots      260
  Carrots        98      Grapes        270
  White of egg  140      Chicken       270
  Pears         160      Plums         290
  Apples        170      Mutton        290
  Haddock       180      Oats          742
  Gooseberries  190      Rye           792
  Peaches       200      Rice          880
  Codfish       210      Barley        920
  Pork          240      Wheat         950


Forests.--About one-quarter of the United States is covered with
forests, with a total acreage of about 550,000,000, about one-fifth of
which are owned by the Government. At the present rate of cutting, and
the forest fires, the forests are decreasing at a very alarming rate,
and a lumber famine is to be expected within the next century, if the
lands are not properly reforested.


Foretelling the Weather

Several years ago the United States Government established a Weather
Bureau and placed it in charge of scientific men and observers who
were expert in this direction. Weather Bureau stations are maintained
throughout the United States, and each station communicates daily with
the head office at Washington. By following the law of averages, by the
use of the barometer and other instruments, by scientific research and
experiment, and because of the receipt of hourly or daily reports,
the Weather Bureau experts are able to foretell the weather with a
considerable degree of accuracy. Practically all of the great storms,
tornadoes, and hurricanes are announced in advance. While this science
is still in its infancy, it has made rapid strides, and each year shows
much improvement in the result. There are a few simple rules, which may
be used for foretelling the weather, if one possesses a barometer.

The rapid rise of the barometer indicates unsettled weather. The
gradual rise foretells settled weather.

When the air is dry and cold, a rising barometer indicates wind from
the north; and if it has been raining, better weather may occur.

When the air is moist and at a low temperature, a rising barometer may
foretell wind and rain from the north.

When there is a northerly wind, and the barometer falls rapidly, there
is likely to be a storm with snow in winter, and heavy rain or hail in
summer.

When the air is dry and the temperature seasonable, a steady barometer
indicates a continuance of fine weather.

A rapidly falling barometer may foretell stormy weather.

When the wind is westerly, a rapid fall may precede a storm coming from
the north.

When the wind is southerly, a rise in the barometer may precede fine
weather.

When there is much moisture in the air and considerable heat, a falling
barometer may indicate that a wind and rain storm is coming from the
south.

When the air is dry and cold in winter a falling barometer may indicate
snow. When the weather is calm and warm, a falling barometer may be
taken to mean rain or squally weather.


=Freemasonry.=--Its origin is unknown, but it is very ancient. It has
been traced to the Knights Templars, to the Crusaders, and others. It
is said that the workmen upon Solomon's Temple were Masons and that
Masonry was the original trade union or protective association for
workmen, each workman by signs being able to prove that he had reached
a certain stage of proficiency; but this has not been substantiated.
Some authorities state that Masonry was introduced into England in 674
A. D. The first record of the establishment of a Grand Lodge was at
York in 926. Freemasonry was introduced into France in 1725, and into
America in 1730. Freemasons are found throughout the entire world,
there being more than a million of them in the United States and
Canada. Other fraternal or mystic orders, known as Odd Fellows, Knights
of Pythias, Red Men, etc., are in purpose similar to Masons, and most
of them were founded upon Masonry, Masonry ante-dating all of them.


=French Academy.=--Founded by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635. It has a
membership of forty, known as the "Forty Immortals." Its principal
object is to prepare a dictionary of the French language and to keep
the Gallic tongue pure and capable of treating the arts and sciences.
The first dictionary appeared in 1694. The Academy has been very
severely criticised, especially in the selection of its members, many
well-known men of letters having failed to be elected.


=Gold in California.=--John W. Marshall, in 1848, in connection with
a man named Sutter, maintained a mill in California. Accidentally he
picked up a small piece of metal which he discovered to be gold, and
immediately the gold fever became epidemic, and California was overrun
with gold miners.


Government

The Constitution of the United Stales is the basic law of the country,
and all other laws and statutes are framed in a similar manner, each
State, county, town, and city having its own laws or statutes.

Government, including that of the United States, is divided into three
distinctive departments: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.

The Executive head is known as President, Governor, Mayor, etc., and it
is his duty to execute the laws.

The Legislative department is usually subdivided into two bodies,--a
Senate or Upper House and a House of Representatives or Lower
House. State Governments are formed similar to that of the National
Government, the Upper House being known as the Senate, and the Lower
House as the House of Representatives or Assembly. Most bills are
presented to the Lower House, and do not become laws until they pass
both the Upper and Lower Houses.

The Legislative authority of a city is usually vested in a board of
Aldermen and a Council or Common Council, but occasionally there is
only one legislative body, known as a Council.

The Commission Form of Government is becoming somewhat prevalent. It
consists of a committee elected by the citizens, who have absolute
control of the government, and this body is both executive and judicial.

The Judicial department consists of several courts: first, the Supreme
Court, and a lower court, usually known as the Superior Court, and
District or Police Courts. Ordinary cases are tried by the Police or
District Courts and may be appealed to the Superior Court and even to
the Supreme Court. Besides these courts there are several courts known
as Probate Court, Court of Equity, etc. The Supreme Court, as a rule,
deals only with questions at law, and few cases reach it which have not
been appealed from the lower courts.


=Grain Industry.=--There was raised in the United States during last
year over 3,000,000,000 bushels of Indian corn, about 730,000,000
bushels of wheat, 1,500,000,000 bushels of oats, about 224,000,000
bushels of barley, about 36,000,000 bushels of rye, and about
19,000,000 bushels of buckwheat.


=Gravity.=--The force of gravity, unscientifically speaking, is
the influence which one body has upon another, commonly known as
attraction. All material substances attempt to draw others to them, and
the larger the substance, the greater its attractiveness or drawing
power. The earth, being larger than anything near it, draws everything
to it. A ball thrown into the air returns to the earth as soon as the
force which propelled it upward is exhausted. If the ball were larger
than the earth, the earth would move toward the ball, or rather each
would move toward the other, but the smaller body would go the greater
distance. The entire universe would, undoubtedly, come together in one
solid mass if the bodies were not held apart by laws and energies,
which are not yet fully understood by men. Sir Isaac Newton discovered
the action of gravity, but no one knows exactly what it is.

  (2) The Planting Machine.
  (3) The Grass Mower and Reaper.
  (4) The Rotary Printing-Press.
  (5) Steam Navigation.

  (14) The Electric Magnet and Its Practical Application.
  (15) The Telephone.


"=Great Eastern.="--The "Great Eastern" was, in her time, the largest
vessel in the world, but would be considered small compared with the
giant ocean liners of to-day. She was built in London and launched in
1858. She cost $300,000. She had a length of 680 ft., breadth of 82-1/2
ft., or 118 ft. including the paddle boxes, and a height of 58 ft. Her
motive power consisted of eight engines with a total of 11,000 horse
power. She was slow and unwieldy, and was not a success except for the
laying of the Atlantic cable.


=Great Libraries.=--The Congressional Library, Washington, contains
1,800,000 volumes; Boston Public Library and New York Public Library,
each 900,000; Harvard University Library, 800,000; New York State
Library, 520,000; Yale University Library, 400,000; Bibliothèque
nationale, Paris, 2,600,000; British Museum, London, 2,000,000;
Imper. publicnaja biblioteka, St. Petersburg, 1,330,000; Königliche
Bibliothek, Berlin, 1,200,000; Kön. Hof-u. Staatsbibliothek, Munich,
1,000,000; K. u. k. Hofbibliothek, Vienna, 900,000.


=Great Tunnels.=--The Arlberg tunnel under the Alps is 6-3/4 miles
long. The Gunnison tunnel in Colorado is 6 miles long. The Hoosac
tunnel in Massachusetts is 4-3/4 miles long. The Mont Cenis in Italy
and France is 8 miles long. The New Croton water tunnel in New York is
33-1/8 miles long. The Otira in New Zealand is 5 1-3 miles long. The
tunnel which drains the Freiberg mines, Saxony, is 31-1/2 miles long.

The St. Clair tunnel, connecting Sarnia, Ont., with Port Huron, Mich.,
is 2 miles long. The St. Gotthard tunnel in the Alps is 9 1-3 miles
long. The Strawberry tunnel in the Wasatch Mountains is 50 miles long.


=Hair Growers.=--Notwithstanding the claims made by advertisers of
patent nostrums, the writer has not as yet heard of a preparation or
treatment which will restore hair after the hair cells are dead. It
appears to be utterly impossible to grow hair upon a bald head, or upon
a bald spot, unless the roots of the hair remain, notwithstanding the
claims made by sellers of hair tonics. Falling hair may be prevented
in many cases by the use of a good hair tonic, but as different
people require different preparations, it is inadvisable to give any
prescription here. A physician should be consulted, and a prescription
obtained from him, adapted to conditions. Many of the advertised hair
tonics contain lead and other poisonous drugs. So far as is known,
there is not a preparation or contrivance of any kind which will
restore gray hair to its former color. All nostrums advertised to do
it are simply hair dyes. The medical profession has not discovered
a method of preventing gray hair. Most of the advertised hair dyes
contain lead and other poisons, and are dangerous to use, and the
dyeing of the hair is not to be recommended even though a nonpoisonous
dye is used. As the dye can only cover the hair in sight, it must be
used constantly, or each separate hair will be of two colors.


=Half-Century of Life.=--A French statistician states that a man fifty
years of age has spent 6000 days in sleep, has worked 6500 days; walked
800 days; enjoyed some amusement 4000 days; spent 1500 days in bed; and
was sick 500 days. He further estimates that this man has eaten 17,000
pounds of bread; 16,000 pounds of meat; 4600 pounds of vegetables,
eggs, and fish; and has drank 7000 gallons of liquid.


=Hawaii.=--The Hawaiian Islands have a total area of 6,740 square
miles, and a population of about 160,000. The climate is semitropical,
and pineapple growing and sugar making are the principal industries.


=Hay Industry.=--Over 48,000,000 acres are devoted to hay, producing
nearly 4,500,000 tons, of a value not far from $50,000,000 a year.


=Health.=--Ninety per cent. of common ailments, and fully one-half of
serious diseases, may be prevented if one gives a reasonable amount
of attention to the care of his health. It would be out of place to
present, in this book, any rules or regulations for the maintenance
of health, assuming that it is possible to do so. Any good physician
is competent to advise in the majority of cases, and will prescribe
beneficial exercise and proper food. Most of us eat too much, and
exercise too little. The province of the physician is as much to keep
people well as it is to cure them. Good sense and economy suggest
that a physician be consulted at least once a year, even by those in
apparent health. So-called "doctors' books" should be avoided, unless
recommended by regular practitioners.

=Influence of the Ocean on the Climate.=--The ocean has much to do with
the climate of its coast. As a rule, land on or near the ocean has
more irregular weather, and is subject to more frequent changes than
is territory some distance away from it. The ocean, besides, exercises
a great influence on heat and cold. The land in close proximity to it
has a warmer climate than territory far removed from it. While the
thermometer in the summer may not show great variation, breezes coming
from the ocean give an apparent coolness which does not exist inland.
For this reason there are more summer resorts located on the ocean than
away from it.


=Insane.=--There are, in the United States, confined in the insane
asylums, about 172,200 persons, about 25,600 being foreigners,
25,000 naturalized citizens, and 121,500 native-born persons. The
feeble-minded number about 150,000.


=Iron Industry.=--The United States produces annually about 24,000,000
tons of pig iron and about the same amount of steel.


=Jewelry Industry.=--Nearly $65,000,000 is invested in the manufacture
of jewelry, and the annual value of the output exceeds $80,000,000.


=John Doe and Richard Roe.=--Two fictitious names, used in law, one
representing the plaintiff and the other the defendant. In writs of
ejection these names are substituted when the real names of the parties
are unknown or in doubt.


=Kissing the Bible.=--The Jews introduced the custom of swearing on
the Bible, and the custom is still maintained throughout the civilized
world, some of the courts even now requiring that the Bible be
literally kissed before one gives testimony.


=Koran.=--The sacred book of the Mohammedans. The doctrine of the
Koran is the unity of God and the existence of one true religion, with
changeable ceremonies. Punishment for the bad, and rewards for the
good, are presented and exemplified by stories taken from the Bible and
other works. Most of the matter is supposed to have been borrowed from
Jewish works, and bears traces of Jewish influence.


=Language of Gems.=--Amethyst represents peace of mind; Bloodstone
signifies that one's absence is mourned; Diamond, pride; Emerald,
success in love; Ruby stands for a cheerful mind; Sapphire represents
chastity, and was supposed to stand for pure thoughts; Topaz, fidelity,
and is supposed to calm the passions; Turquoise, happiness and success;
Garnet, fidelity; Onyx, reciprocal love; Opal, pure thoughts; Pearl,
innocence and purity.


=Languages of the World.=--It is estimated that there are 3424 distinct
languages or dialects, about 1600 being spoken in America, about 940
in Asia, not far from 600 in Europe, and about 275 in Africa. Probably
more than 150,000,000 people speak the English language, 120,000,000
the German, 90,000,000 Russian, 60,000,000 French, 55,000,000 Spanish,
40,000,000 Italian, 30,000,000 Portuguese. The English dictionaries
contain exceeding 600,000 words, about 300,000 of which are more or
less technical and obsolete. Ordinary conversation does not require
the use of more than 2,000 words. It is said that one can make himself
understood in any language if his vocabulary is about 1,500 words.

=Law.=--Every one within the United States is amenable: first, to the
laws laid down by the Constitution of the United States; secondly,
to any laws which may be made by Congress; thirdly, to State laws;
fourthly, to county law; fifthly, to local ordinances passed by the
city or town. No local ordinance can be enforced if it is contrary
to the law of the State, and no State law holds if it is at variance
with the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court of each
State passes upon the constitutionality of all laws made within the
State, and the Supreme Court of the United States is the final Court
of appeal. A law made by Congress is not valid if it is declared
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, nor may any
State law be enforced if the Supreme Court of that State considers it
unconstitutional.

101,000,000 gallons of whisky, about 2,700,000 gallons of rum, about
3,400,000 gallons of gin, 24,500,000 gallons of alcohol, and about

gallons. The United States produces over 2,000,000 gallons of malt
liquors and nearly 57,000,000 gallons of wine annually.


=Literature.=--Literature is not, and probably never will be,
satisfactorily defined. Broadly speaking, it is any form of written
or printed words upon any subject. More specifically defined, the
term "literature" would apply to essays, poetry, stories, and other
works of fiction of the grade acceptable to the best magazines and
book publishers. Works of history may be called literature, and
scientific works come under this classification; but historical writers
are usually called historians, and scientific writers are known as
scientists. Story writers are usually classified as novelists, and
newspaper writers as journalists. A book, commonly, if not technically,
speaking, is a volume usually bound in board covers and containing one
hundred or more pages, but it may be a book if there are only a dozen
pages with covers of paper.


=Magnetic Poles.=--The magnetic poles are not, as most people suppose,
identical with the geographical poles, the north magnetic pole being
south of the geographical North Pole, and the south magnetic pole
being north of the geographical South Pole. The north magnetic pole is
located at about 77° 59´, and the south at about 72° 23´.


=Mammoth Cave.=--Mammoth Cave, probably the best known of similar
freaks of Nature, is located in Kentucky, and has a length of nine
miles. It contains many avenues, chambers, domes, lakes, rivers, and
waterfalls. Echo River, inside of the cave, is 3/4 of a mile in length,
from a few feet to 200 ft. wide, and has a depth of from 10 to 30 ft.
It is well filled with fish, none of which have eyes.


=Meat Industry.=--There are, in the United States, about 1650 slaughter
houses employing nearly 110,000 people with about $4,000,000 capital
invested. The annual product of the meat industry is not far from
$1,400,000,000.


=Medicine Chests.=--Every one should maintain a medicine chest or shelf
containing simple remedies, but these should never be selected without
the advice of a physician. Thousands of persons injure themselves by
self-dosing. When in the slightest doubt, visit or call your doctor.
Most ailments can be prevented or cured by a skillful physician, but
if allowed to run they may result seriously or fatally. Do not take
chances with yourself.


=Microscope.=--The first microscope is said to have been invented by
a Dutchman in 1590, but its invention has been attributed to Galileo
in 1610. The microscope has been perfected until a millionth part of a
grain of blood may be detected by means of the spectrum lens.


=Mineral Industry.=--The minerals mined in the United States every year
have a value of about $904,000,000.


=Mining Industry.=--Nearly 1,140,000 men are engaged in the mines of
the United States, over 90 per cent of whom are wage earners.


=Moon.=--The moon is the earth's only satellite. It circles around the
earth every 27 days, 7 hours, and 43.2 minutes, on the average; but
because its motion is common with the earth around the sun, the mean
duration of the lunar month is 29 days, 12 hours, 44.05 minutes. The
distance from the earth to the moon is from 238,850 to 252,820 miles,
although at times the moon is only 216,477 miles from the earth. The
moon's diameter is 2,162 miles. The surface of the moon contains about
14,685,000 square miles, or about four times the area of Europe. The
moon, although very much smaller than the planets, exerts a stronger
attractive force on the earth because of its nearness. The moon is,
unscientifically speaking, drawing everything on the earth towards it,
while at the same time the earth is exerting the same attractive force
upon the moon. Because of this, the oceans, being composed of water,
which is easily movable, respond and move with the moon, causing the
tides. This same attractive force is brought to bear upon the earth
itself, but because it is of greater density it is not perceptibly
affected. Theoretically, every lake and pond has a tide, but the
motion of the water is too slight to be measured. The moon is supposed
to possess neither atmosphere nor water. Thousands of ages ago the
lunar surface was subjected to terrible volcanic actions which forced
the land into ridges, some of them supposed to exceed 20,000 feet in
height, and rents and depressions of corresponding depths. The surface
of the moon appears to be desolate and to be unfitted to support any
form of life.


=Mortality.=--About 15 people out of every thousand of the population
of the United States die during each year. The percentage of male
deaths is somewhat larger than that of female, due to accidents. The
annual death rate per thousand is: 13.7 in Los Angeles, 15 in San
Francisco, 17 in Denver, 19 in Washington, D. C., 14.6 in Chicago,
14.3 in Indianapolis, 15.5 in Louisville, 20.2 in New Orleans, 18.7
in Baltimore, 16.8 in Boston, 14.0 in Detroit, 10.7 in Minneapolis,
11.4 in St. Paul, 14.4 in Kansas City, 15.8 in St. Louis, 14.7 in
Omaha, 16 in New York, 16.5 in Cincinnati, 12.9 in Cleveland, 16.4 in
Philadelphia, 15.8 in Pittsburgh, 20.1 in Memphis.


=Mortgages.=--A mortgage is a bill-of-sale from the owner of property
to another competent to hold property. The one giving the mortgage
is called the mortgagee, and the one to whom it is made is known as
the mortgagor. A mortgage differs from a bill-of-sale in that the
mortgagor cannot obtain ownership of the property mortgaged, unless the
amount involved is not paid him at the expiration of the mortgage, or
the interest is not met. All mortgages must be registered. Mortgaged
property cannot be moved, altered, or changed without the consent of
the mortgagor. The property, unless it is land, should be insured, and
the insurance policy made payable to the mortgagor in case of loss by
fire, but the mortgagor can collect only that part of the insurance
money which represents the amount of the mortgage. Should the mortgagee
fail to pay interest at the period stated in the mortgage, or should
he be unable or refuse to liquidate the mortgage at its expiration,
the mortgagor cannot seize the property except by act of law. It must
be advertised and sold at auction. If the mortgaged property brings
a price lower than the face of the mortgage, the mortgagor loses the
difference, and has to bear the expense of foreclosure. If more than
the face of the mortgage is realized, the mortgagee is entitled to
what is received, less the face of the mortgage and the expenses of
foreclosure.


=Natural Gas.=--A gas generated underground, and due to chemical action
beneath the earth's surface. It is found in various parts of the world,
and is used for fuel and illuminating, largely for the former.


=Naturalization.=--Any foreigner or alien, except those of the
Mongolian or Brown Race, may become a citizen of the United States, and
be entitled to every privilege granted to natural-born citizens, except
that he cannot become President or Vice-President of the United States.
An alien cannot make application for naturalization or citizenship
until he is 18 years of age, and he cannot apply for his Second or
Final Paper of Naturalization until he has lived in the United States
for at least five years, and he must make his Declaration of Intention
two or more years before he applies for his Second or Final Paper. The
applicant must be a resident of the State in which he makes petition
for naturalization not less than one year, and have lived at least
four years additional in the same State, or in some other State. He
must make application to the United States District Court in the State
in which he lives. The cost of becoming naturalized is less than
$5.00. A married woman does not have to be naturalized if her husband
has become a citizen of the United States, and the children of the
naturalized parents become citizens at 21 years of age without taking
out naturalization papers. Full particulars regarding the process
of naturalization are very plainly and explicitly stated in a book
entitled "How to Obtain Citizenship," by Nathaniel C. Fowler, Jr.


=Newspapers.=--A newspaper is a periodical issued as often as once a
week, and contains the news of the day, either local or general, or
both. The majority of newspapers are of four or eight pages, but often
the number of pages run as high as 24, or even 72, and occasionally
100 pages are issued at a time. In the United States and Canada,
there are published over 2,600 daily newspapers, about 75 tri-weekly,
a little less than 650 semi-weekly, considerable more than 17,000
weekly. Of other periodicals, about 60 are published every two weeks,
somewhat less than 300 semi-monthly, more than 3,000 monthly, about 80
bi-monthly, and less than 250 quarterly. Periodicals published less
often than once a week are not considered newspapers, although they may
contain news.


=New York Stock Exchange.=--A single seat, carrying with it membership
in the New York Stock Exchange, has been sold for as much as $96,000,
and the lowest price recorded is $49,500.


=Nicknames of States.=--Alabama, "Cotton State"; Alaska, "Eldorado of
the North"; Arkansas, "Bear"; California, "Golden Land"; Colorado,
"Centennial State"; Connecticut, "Nutmeg"; Delaware, "Blue Hen" and
"Diamond State"; Florida, "Gulf" and "Flowery State"; Georgia, "Cracker
State"; Indiana, "Hoosier State"; Iowa, "Hawkeye"; Kansas, "Prairie";
Kentucky, "Blue Grass State"; Louisiana, "Creole State"; Maine, "Pine
Tree State"; Maryland, "Old Line State"; Massachusetts, "Old Bay
State"; Michigan, "Lake State"; Minnesota, "Gopher State"; Mississippi,
"Bayou State"; Missouri, "Bullion State"; Montana, "Mountain State";
Nebraska, "Black Water State"; Nevada, "Silver State"; New Hampshire,

Tennessee, "Old Franklin State"; South Carolina, "Palmetto State";
South Dakota, "Blizzard State"; Texas, "Lone-Star State"; Utah, "Mormon
State"; Vermont, "Green Mountain State"; Virginia, "Old Dominion"; West
Virginia, "Panhandle State"; Wisconsin, "Badger State".


=Nitroglycerine.=--Nitroglycerine is made of common glycerine mixed
with strong nitric and sulphuric acids, and is extremely explosive
and dangerous. It has to be exploded by concussion or shock, and not
by fire. It is used for blasting and other purposes, and occasionally
is taken in very small doses as a medicine, but never should be used
medicinally except by the advice of a physician who should be present
when it is taken.


=Notes.=--A note should be signed in ink, but a pencil signature is
good in law. A note is not payable on demand unless it so states. A
note may be payable to order or to bearer. If payable to order, and
transferred, it must be endorsed. The endorser of a note is liable for
its payment, if the maker of it does not pay it. Each signer of a joint
note is liable for the full amount. Notes do not bear interest unless
so stated. "Value received" should be written in every note, but it is
not essential.


=Ocean Ownership.=--The ocean is common property, and no one has any
legal title to it, except that each country has jurisdiction over the
sea within three miles of the shore, but these three miles are usually
reckoned from promontories, and not necessarily from the coast-line,
so that a nation may have control of a vast area of water and several
hundred miles from shore.


=Old Time Ships.=--The glory of the American merchant service, so
far as sailing vessels are concerned, has passed into history.
Comparatively few sailing vessels, save coasting schooners, ply the
seas, as steam has taken the place of sail. The majority of old ship
captains are either dead or commanding ocean liners or coastwise
steamers. In the old days, sailing clipper ships made the trip from
New York to San Francisco in one hundred days, while the voyage of
ordinary ships was two or three times as long. The old ship "Lightning"
sailed from Boston to Liverpool at a greater speed than that obtained
by any steamship of its day, the vessel often logging over 500 miles
in 24 hours, and it made the trip in a little less than 14 days.
The "James Baines" sailed from Boston to Liverpool in 12 days and 6
hours, and broke the sailing record between these two ports. The same
vessel made the trip from Liverpool to Melbourne, Australia, in 63
days and returned in 69 days. The "Red Jacket" sailed from New York
to Liverpool in 13 days, 1 hour, and 25 minutes. The "Flying Cloud"
and "Andrew Jackson" sailed from New York to San Francisco in 89 days,
and the "Sea Witch" made the trip from Canton, China, to New York in
74 days, 14 hours. These early clipper ships were quite small, many
of them not being over 200 tons. The first large clipper ship was the
"Ann McKim," which was 43 ft. long, and 493 tons burden. Subsequent
sailing vessels of enormous size were built, the "John Bertram" having
a tonnage of 1080, the "Gamecock" 1,320, the "Staghound" 1,535, the
"Flying Cloud" 1,783, the "Staffordshire" 1,817, the "Sovereign of the
Seas" 2,421 tons, and the "Great Republic" 4,555 tons.


=Palmistry.=--The study of the lines of the palm, which the ancients
believed indicated character and future. Palmistry is to-day practiced
by three classes of people: (1) professional palmists, most of whom
are charlatans; (2) as a diversion; (3) by superstitious people who
believe in it. A scientific study of the subject does not furnish any
evidence that the lines of the hand have any special significance, and
no scientific person gives them any credence.


=Partnership.=--A partnership is an agreement, usually written, between
two or more persons, for the doing of business or for the carrying out
of any contract or for the accomplishment of any work. The partners
may have equal ownership, or it may
