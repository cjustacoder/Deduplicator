                                                  _President-General_.

  THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,
        _Secretary-General_ (77 Main St., Woonsocket, R. I.).

    Dec. 31, 1899.

The business session was well attended, several states being
represented.

Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary-general of the Society, presented the
following annual report:


                    REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.

  The American-Irish Historical Society is on the threshold of its
  fourth year of existence. We are strong in numbers, representative
  in character and devoted to a patriotic work.

  Our growth as an organization has been rapid, but not unstable;
  widespread, but healthy; vigorous, and of permanent value.

  We have solid reason to be proud of what the Society has
  accomplished during the three years it has been in the field. We
  have been accorded a generous welcome from historical societies long
  in existence; our advent has been hailed with satisfaction; our
  motives praised; our publications eagerly sought.

  To-night we meet in New York city for the third time, and for the
  third time we are indebted to our New York members for unbounded
  hospitality, kindliest service and tireless efforts to make our
  annual gathering a success.

  During the year just closed, ninety-two new members have been
  admitted to the Society, and ten of our brothers have died. These
  deaths of the year removed from our ranks the following: Hon.
  Patrick Walsh, Augusta, Ga.; Col. Patrick T. Hanley, Boston, Mass.;
  Hon. John H. Sullivan, Boston, Mass.; Hon. Eli Thayer, Worcester,
  Mass.; Dr. William F. Cummings, Rutland, Vt.; Mr. Joseph J. Kelley,
  Cambridge, Mass.; Mr. William Slattery, Holyoke, Mass.; Rev. George
  W. Pepper, Cleveland, O.; Rev. Denis Scannell, Worcester, Mass.; and
  Mr. Edmund Phelan, Boston, Mass.

  Since our last annual gathering in this city, meetings under the
  auspices of the Society have been held in Providence, R. I.,
  Newport, R. I., and Boston, Mass. In each instance great interest
  was manifested in the mission of the organization, and new members
  were secured.

  Among those in attendance at the Providence meeting was Hon. John D.
  Crimmins, our esteemed general vice-president. On that occasion he
  subscribed $500 to forward the interests of the Society, this being
  the largest individual gift the organization has thus far received.
  Among the speakers at this meeting were the Rev. S. B. Nelson, an
  Irish Presbyterian clergyman, and Rev. Frank L. Phalen, a Unitarian.

  At the Newport meeting, the mayor of the city, Hon. Patrick J.
  Boyle, a member of our Society, presided and delivered an address of
  welcome. Addresses were also made by Hon. Charles E. Gorman of
  Providence; by Rev. Louis J. Deady, a Catholic rector of Newport; by
  City Solicitor Brown of Newport; by Dennis H. Tierney of Waterbury,
  Conn.; by Hon. John C. Linehan of Concord, N. H., and other
  gentlemen.

  At the Boston meeting, President-General Gargan presided, and there
  were addresses by Hon. Patrick A. Collins of Boston and a number of
  others.

  Nor, during the year, has the Society been idle in the field of
  research. Of our members: Mr. Edward Fitzpatrick, Louisville, Ky.,
  has contributed a paper on “The Irish Settlers of Kentucky”; Mr.
  Daniel M. O’Driscoll, Charleston, S. C., has written on “David
  Hamilton, an Irish Soldier of the American Revolution”; Mr. Thomas
  F. O’Malley, Somerville, Mass., has devoted much investigation
  relative to “The Early Transportation of Irish Men, Women and
  Children to the West Indies, to Virginia, and to New England”; Hon.
  John C. Linehan, Concord, N. H., has prepared a paper “On the Irish
  Pioneers of Texas”; Mr. M. E. Hennessy, Boston, Mass., on “Men of
  Irish Birth or Extraction Who Have Attained Distinction in American
  Journalism”; and Mr. Joseph Smith, Lowell, Mass., on “The Irish
  Brigade of Rochambeau’s Army in the American Revolutionary War.” Mr.
  Thomas Carroll, Peabody, Mass., a member of our Society, recently
  delivered an historical address at a church anniversary in that
  place.

  Two of the leading works by our members during the year are those of
  Rev. John J. McCoy of Chicopee, Mass., and Rev. James H. O’Donnell
  of Watertown, Conn. The former has written a history of the Catholic
  diocese of Springfield, Mass., and the latter of the Catholic
  diocese of Hartford, Conn. Both these productions are rich in
  reference to early Irish settlers, that of Rev. Father O’Donnell
  being practically a history of the Irish in Connecticut.

  The annual bound volume of our Society is now in press. It will be
  larger than the book we issued last year, will be illustrated and
  will contain many papers, addresses and other matter of historical
  and literary value.

  At our last annual meeting, the matter of a publication fund was
  discussed and referred to the council of the Society for action. The
  council subsequently decided to issue a circular letter inviting
  contributions to said fund.

  It was decided to send out these circulars immediately after some
  important gathering under the auspices of the Society, when they
  would be likely to attract special interest. The launching of the
  United States torpedo-boat _O’Brien_, at Elizabeth, N. J., was
  finally decided upon as such event.

  Owing to unavoidable delay, however, this launching has not yet
  taken place, and thus a desirable opportunity has not, up to this
  time, presented itself to formulate the circular. I would suggest,
  however, that this meeting possesses the desired prominence as a
  Society event, and that the circular can now be sent out within the
  next week or two.

  During the year, Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet of this city has voluntarily
  subscribed $100 toward the publication fund, and four New York
  gentlemen—Mr. Myles Tierney, Mr. Stephen J. Geoghegan, Mr. James
  McGovern and Mr. John J. Lenehan—have each forwarded a check for $50
  in payment of life membership fee. Mr. William Gorman of
  Philadelphia, Pa., has also become a life member.

  In April next, the historic town of Lexington, Mass., is to have a
  great celebration of the anniversary of the battle of April 19,
  1775, and our Society has been invited to be represented on that
  occasion.

  Some months ago, a Franco-American Historical Society was organized
  at Boston, at which an official of our Society was present and made
  an address of congratulation. The new organization will devote
  itself to the French chapter in American history.

  In conclusion, I desire to say that the correspondence of the
  Society has already become of considerable volume. Inquiries from
  all sections of the country are being constantly received. The
  writers seek information or data of an historical nature relative to
  the Irish and their descendants in the United States. These
  inquiries are promptly answered, and, in return, we receive much
  valuable material.

                          Respectfully submitted,
                                      THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY,
                                                  _Secretary-General_.

The foregoing report was accepted and adopted.


                    REPORT OF THE TREASURER-GENERAL.

The treasurer-general of the Society, Hon. John C. Linehan of Concord,
N. H., then presented his annual report. It showed the total income for
the year 1899 to have been $2,228.50. Cash balance on hand Jan. 1, 1899,
$518.60, thus making the total financial resources of the Society for
the year $2,747.10.

The expenditures for 1899, as set forth in detail in the report, were
$2,008.86, leaving a balance on hand of $738.24.

Joseph Smith of Lowell, Mass., for the auditing committee, reported
having examined the books and vouchers of the treasurer-general and
found the same correct.

The treasurer-general’s report was thereupon accepted and adopted.

A communication to the society was announced from Hon. Theodore
Roosevelt, governor of New York, in which he invited the members to be
his guests at the executive mansion in Albany.

The invitation was appreciatively received and acknowledged, and the
president-general was authorized to appoint a delegation to represent
the society by a visit to the governor.

The president-general announced that he would do so, and state the
make-up of the delegation later.

Hon. T. A. E. Weadock of Detroit, Mich., an ex-member of Congress,
presented the names of several applicants for membership in the Society,
and the said applicants were unanimously admitted.

Various other gentlemen also presented many applications for membership,
and the same were all favorably acted upon.

The annual election of officers of the Society then took place, the
result being the same as given on pages 5, 6 and 7 of this volume.

Upon the conclusion of the business meeting, the members and guests
formed in line and proceeded to the banquet hall.


                     ANNUAL BANQUET OF THE SOCIETY.

The company around the tables numbered about one hundred and thirty
gentlemen. President-General Gargan presided. An orchestra was stationed
in the balcony. The decorations were profuse, and were artistically
placed.

Vice-President-General John D. Crimmins, who was at Palm Beach, Fla.,
for his health, sent a telegram regretting his absence, and adding:

“Our Society should flourish. The field is ripe, and so far the surface
is only scratched. When in deeper furrows, forgotten history will be
brought forth that will glorify the deeds of the Irish race in building
our nation.”

Letters of regret at inability to be present were received from Mayor
Van Wyck of New York city, Hon. Patrick A. Collins of Boston, Mass., and
other gentlemen.


                    THE PRESIDENT-GENERAL’S ADDRESS.

President-General Gargan, in rising to open the exercises, spoke
substantially as follows:

  GENTLEMEN OF THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY: In January,
  1897, the first meeting to organize this Society was called at
  Boston. As the reports show, we have now nearly 1,000 members
  residing in almost every state and territory in the United States,
  and representing the best elements in the several walks of life.

  Our object is to see that history is written fairly and impartially.
  During the last twenty-five years we have adopted new methods in
  writing history. The historian who is to write on any epoch no
  longer accepts as truth the recorded facts of another historian who
  has written of a former epoch. He challenges every statement made
  unless corroborated or verified by documentary proof.

  We now have access to many valuable papers and letters that throw a
  new light upon men, their motives and action.

  The history of the United States has been largely written by men of
  English blood, who have unduly glorified the actions of their
  ancestors. More critical and scientific examinations have shown us
  that the Irish element contributed very largely to the settlement of
  the colonies from New England to Georgia, and were an important
  factor in bringing about the Revolution and establishing the
  government of the United States.

  Our Society is now engaged in searching many of the colonial
  records, and I suggest that the members in the different states of
  the Union examine into the origin and ancestry of the prominent men
  in their states, prepare information and write papers that may be
  placed in the archives of this Society.

  I congratulate the members on the increase in numbers, the continued
  prosperity of the Society, and urge all who can to contribute
  liberally to the publication fund, for spoken words are often but
  perishable things, and if the history of the part which our race and
  blood have borne in upbuilding the Republic is to be preserved, we
  can only keep alive the record of their sacrifices, their heroism
  and their patriotism by preserving them in the form of permanent
  memorials, books and publications of the Society.


                     THE ADDRESS OF SENATOR CARTER.

Hon. Thomas H. Carter, U. S. senator from Montana, made an eloquent
address. In the course of his speech he paid deserved compliments to
Hon. P. A. Collins of Boston, Hon. John D. Crimmins and General O’Beirne
of New York, and to other members of the society.

Senator Carter showed the absurdity of calling the United States an
Anglo-Saxon country, and traced the expansion of the original thirteen
states, and the wonderful resources of America. He said in substance:

  A new race has sprung up in this country better than Saxon or Celt.
  The success of the Republic is due to the fact that it unbridles
  manhood. The special purpose of this association is to ascertain
  what part dear old Ireland has played in this drama.

  I am gratified beyond expression that this Society insists on seeing
  justice done to the race from which we have sprung. The work must be
  logical and correct. One of the most remarkable things is the
  intellectuality of the Irish race.

  Wherever freedom’s flag is hoisted you will find an Irishman at or
  near that emblem. O’Higgins in South America is synonymous with
  liberty. On every battlefield in North America the Irishman is
  found, as he also is in poetry, history, arts and sciences. I would
  not adulate the race. The Irishman forms only a part of the American
  citizenship. But whether it is in storming Manila or the capital of
  Great Britain the Irishman will be found doing his work
  enthusiastically.

  I would be delighted to see the Society extended to every state of
  the Union. There are many, very many, incidents in connection with
  the Irish race in America I would like to see set down. As a rule
  the Irish hold the offices, not because they are Irish, but as a
  recognition of ability and the eternal fitness of things.

Senator Carter spoke eloquently in praise of Gen. Thomas Francis
Meagher, one of the original white settlers of Montana, who died while
holding the office of governor of that territory.

Spirited addresses were also made by Hon. Thomas M. Waller, ex-governor
of Connecticut; Judge Wauhope Lynn of New York city; Ex-Congressman
Weadock of Michigan; Hon. William McAdoo of New York; George E. Van
Siclen, who spoke eloquently in behalf of the Boers of South Africa, and
Gen. James R. O’Beirne of New York.

Vocal selections were rendered during the evening, and Miss Sullivan of
New York gave selections on the harp.




            CELEBRATION OF THE LEXINGTON BATTLE ANNIVERSARY.


                   EXERCISES AT LEXINGTON AND BOSTON.

On April 19, 1900, the Society observed the 125th anniversary of the
battle of Lexington, Mass. In connection with the celebration, two
notices were issued to the members, viz.:

                   AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

   (Founded, 1897. First President-General, Rear Admiral R. W. Meade,
                               U. S. N.)

       OBSERVANCE OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON.

  BROTHERS: You are hereby notified that the 125th anniversary of the
  battle of Lexington and “the Concord Fight” will be observed by our
  Society on Thursday, April 19, 1900.

  Our programme for this patriotic occasion will comprise two leading
  features, namely: (1) A visit to Lexington, Mass., in the forenoon,
  and (2) a banquet in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston,
  Mass. Lady friends of the members will be welcome at both events.

  The exercises prepared by the town of Lexington for the day include
  a national salute of 45 guns, morning and evening, a drum corps
  parade at dawn over the historic route of march, and a trades
  procession about midday. Headquarters for the society will be
  established in Lexington at the Russell House, where a reception
  committee will be in attendance.

  The Society will pay its respects to the town officials of
  Lexington, will visit the several points of historic interest and
  will then place a laurel wreath to the memory of the heroes of 1775.
  Members and guests from Boston may take trains from the North Union
  station, that city, at such hour in the morning as may suit their
  convenience, all meeting at the Russell House, Lexington, about
  11:30 a. m. Those desiring, may later take conveyances for Concord.

  The banquet in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston, promises
  to be a brilliant event and should be attended by every member who
  can possibly be present. Preceding the banquet, from 6:30 to 8,
  there will be a reception and concert, and at 8 p. m. the company
  will proceed to the dining hall.

  Tickets for the banquet will be three dollars each, and are now
  ready. Please notify the secretary as soon as possible if you intend
  to be present at the banquet, and whether you will be accompanied by
  guests.

                                  Fraternally,
                                              THOMAS J. GARGAN,
                                                  _President-General_.

  Soon after, we will proceed to the monument on the historic green,
  and there place a memorial wreath, addresses being made by members
  of our Society and invited guests.


                    THE CELEBRATION AT THE BELLEVUE.

  But the most interesting feature of the anniversary will be our
  celebration in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston, Mass. The
  reception and concert will be from 6:30 to 8 p. m., and the banquet
  at 8.

                                      Fraternally,
                                              THOMAS J. GARGAN,

were shown objects of historical interest connected with the battle.
Christopher S. Ryan, the special committee on the part of the town to
receive the members of the Society, did so in a most gratifying manner.

Shortly before noon, the members and guests proceeded to the battle
monument on the “Green” and attached thereto a large wreath, inscribed

                  REMARKS OF PRESIDENT-GENERAL GARGAN.

  _Members and guests of the American-Irish Historical Society_:

  To-day we commemorate the deeds of those heroic men who on April 19,
  1775, on the green at Lexington, won a fame as imperishable as the
  men who fought at Marathon or Thermopylæ. Well might Sam Adams
  exclaim, “What a glorious morning for America is this.” As a
  distinguished foreigner has well said, “It is their sacrificed blood
  in which is written the preface of the nation’s history.”

  At Lexington was the opening scene of a revolution destined to
  change the character of human governments and the condition of the
  human race. Yet I sometimes incline to the opinion, as I read the
  utterances of men who in our day are called statesmen, and some of
  the newspapers, that the age of patriotism has gone; that an age of
  selfish materialists, economists, and calculators has succeeded. Let
  us hope there is still a saving remnant in this republic which will
  rekindle the love and patriotism which actuated the men who
  established our government.

  Do some of the people really understand the meaning of patriotism?
  Many seem to imagine it means blind obedience to any administration
  which may be insidiously laboring to destroy our institutions. But I
  have an abiding faith in the people of this country when they fully
  appreciate a threatened danger. I believe with Burke “that the
  people never give up their liberties but under some delusion.”

  Are some of us laboring under the delusion that we are called upon
  to govern the world, that we are to set forth with a few small
  Bibles and a large supply of arms to force what we call our
  civilization on an unwilling people in another hemisphere, while
  thoughtful men are staggered at the problems of government
  confronting us on the North American continent?

  Shall we not profit by the lessons of history and recall what this
  day means? It was the beginning of a movement against an empire
  which aspired to govern the world. Yet those men on Lexington common
  initiated a revolution which wrested from the diadem of Great
  Britain the fairest jewel in her crown. May we not indulge to-day
  somewhat in retrospection and examine the causes which led to our
  revolt?

  The British parliament had passed the stamp act, the tea tax and the
  Boston port bill, yet those did not cause war; the real cause of the
  battle of Lexington was the reconstruction act of 1774. Prior to
  this act the councilors had been chosen by the people through their
  representatives. By the new law the king was to appoint them, to
  hold office during his pleasure. The superior judges were to hold at
  the will of the king and to be dependent on his will for the amount
  and payment of their salaries; the inferior judges were to be
  removable by the royal governor at his discretion, he himself
  holding at the king’s will.

  The deepest reaching provision of the acts was aimed at the
  town-meetings. They were prohibited, except the annual meeting to
  elect officers, but no other meetings could be held without the
  written permission of the royal governor. These acts of parliament
  sought to change self-government into government by the king, and to
  substitute for home rule, absolute rule at Westminster and St.
  James’s palace.

  Then came the military act, and in February, 1775, parliament
  declared Massachusetts in rebellion. The instructions of Lord
  Dartmouth, the secretary of state for the colonies, to General Gage,
  the royal governor, ran like this: “Sovereignty of the king over the
  colonies requires a full and absolute submission.” What a striking
  similarity that has to some recent dispatches we have heard since we
  acquired distant possessions.

  General Gage’s call for 20,000 men, the assembling of 5,000 troops
  at Boston, and the authority given to General Gage to fire on the
  people, made war inevitable. We see again how history repeats
  itself.

  The people in spite of royal mandates continued to hold their own
  town-meetings, organized county meetings, and made a provincial
  congress. The convention at Middlesex “Resolved, if in support of
  our rights we are called to encounter death we are yet undaunted,
  sensible that he can never die too soon who lays down his life in
  support of the laws and liberties of his country.” Lexington wrote
  to Boston, “We trust in God that should the state of affairs require
  it, we shall be ready to sacrifice our estates and everything dear
  in life, yea, and life itself, in support of the common cause.”

  Nobly did the men of Lexington fulfil that pledge. Shall we in our
  day forget what these men did and dared? Are we so saturated with
  the spirit of commercialism, are we so wedded to the worship of the
  golden calf, that justice and humanity have no place in our modern
  code?

  Let us remember we shall be tried at the bar of history as have been
  other nations; as our opportunities have been greater, so are our
  responsibilities. We cannot escape our liabilities; it is for us to
  so act in the present that this experiment of a free government,
  founded upon manhood suffrage, shall not fail.


                   LETTERS AND PATRIOTIC SENTIMENTS.

  Letters of regret at inability to be present were received from
  ex-Gov. John Lee Carroll of Maryland, president of the Sons of the
  Revolution; Governor Roosevelt of New York, President Eliot of
  Harvard, President Hadley of Yale, Senator Hoar of Massachusetts,
  Senators Hale and Frye of Maine, Senator Mason of Illinois, David
  Starr Jordon, president of Leland Stanford University; E. Benjamin
  Andrews, superintendent of public schools, Chicago; Congressman
  Sulzer of New York, Rector Conaty of the Catholic University,
  President Harper of the University of Chicago, Rev. James H.
  O’Donnell, Watertown, Conn.; Hon. Thomas J. Lynch, Augusta, Me.;
  Hon. James S. Coleman, New York city; Col. John P. Donahoe,
  Wilmington, Del.; Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn.; Col. James
  Quinlan, New York city; John J. Davis, Greenville, Pa.; James
  Connolly, Coronado, Cal.; Col. James Moran, Providence, R. I., and
  from several others.

  Ex-Gov. Carroll of Maryland wrote: “If we contrast the pitiful
  resources of those early days with the present happiness, wealth and
  prosperity of our united country, we can realize the courage of
  those daring men who openly proclaimed that our only purpose was to
  obtain our freedom ‘peaceably if we could, forcibly if we must.’”

  E. Benj. Andrews of Chicago declared: “I assure you that nothing but
  my distance from you prevents my attendance. I should be pleased to
  attend, not only to hear the distinguished gentlemen who will be
  present, but also to testify anew the reverence which all true
  patriots must feel for the brave men who immortalized themselves by
  standing for liberty on Lexington green, 125 years ago.”

  Senator Hoar wrote: “It will not be in my power to attend the
  celebration of the 19th of April in Boston by the American-Irish
  Historical Society. But I am sure that the celebration will be in
  the spirit which animated the men who fought and the men who died on
  the 19th of April, 1775. You will, I am sure, reinforce the lesson
  that no human power can turn wrong into right, injustice into
  justice, or lawfully crush out the love of liberty native in every
  human soul and the right to independence that belongs to every
  people.”

  Gov. Roosevelt said in his letter: “I wish I could be present with
  you at the celebration of the battle of Lexington. It is peculiarly
  appropriate for men of Irish stock to take part in this celebration,
  for they have always done even more than their proper share of
  valiant fighting for the republic.”

  Congressman Sulzer wrote: “I regret exceedingly my inability to
  accept owing to imperative official duties here which demand my
  presence in Washington. If ever there was a time in the history of
  the republic when we should celebrate the battle of Lexington it is
  this year, and I trust your celebration will be a great success in
  every way.”

  From Congressman Capron of Rhode Island: “I am inclined to refer to
  the patriots who fought in the great struggle which initiated the
  war for independence and human liberty with the deepest devotion
  akin to reverence. The event itself should be held in grateful
  remembrance.... Let every American if he would find the spirit which
  animated the men of Lexington look down into his own being and
  analyze the feelings lying there, and if he be a true American he
  will find love of God, love of country, love of home, love of
  liberty, love of law and love of man, all and each of which are the
  essential components of that which we call patriotism. My colleague,
  Mr. Bull, who was also the recipient of your invitation, desires me
  to express his thanks therefor and to say that he heartily joins in
  the sentiments herein expressed.”


                  PRESIDENT HALL OF CLARK UNIVERSITY.

President G. Stanley Hall of Clark University, Worcester, Mass., upon
being introduced, stated that among his ancestors was a Mary Hennessy of
Limerick, Ireland. He then went on to say that:

  The three characteristics of the Irish race, which are most to be
  commended when rightly directed, are, first, their heartiness,
  geniality, enjoyment of life, a nameless quality made of the best
  elements of the German gemuth and the French esprit. This is the
  temperament of genius, it is the conserved youth which makes the
  Irishman an adolescent at whatever age, and is strongly contrasted
  with the sternness and reserve of the Puritan. This temperament,
  too, is connected with the fecundity of the race, also in contrast
  with the Puritan New Englanders, who even in Boston may ere long
  have to hail the Irish race with _morituri salutamus_ with a new
  meaning in it.

  Second, the Irishman, like other men, is not always a man of peace.
  His blood is warmer on occasion and his interpretation of the
  strenuous life, which makes men loved for the enemies they make, is
  another quality which, when rightly trained and directed, is one of
  the greatest powers for good in the world. To be angry aright is
  almost one of the definitions of education.

  Third, the Irishman has a veritable genius for politics, which had
  no scope in the earlier formative days of Irish history, but which
  finds its legitimate sphere in this republican land. He is also a
  patriot, a superb soldier. Politics culminates in statesmanship, and
  I cannot forbear here a word which I believe will appeal to every
  heart which keeps a warm corner for Burke, Emmet or O’Connell.

  My conception of statesmanship is higher than that of politics. The
  first of all conditions of success in its purer realm is utter
  disinterestedness. Within the last few days, this country has
  witnessed the rare spectacle of a senator,[1] unusually devoted to
  the party at whose birth he assisted, and to a president whom he has
  long loved, placing his convictions, matured by long experience and
  ripe knowledge, above both. To no temperament could the personal
  sacrifices have been greater than for him to give us this modern
  version of Aristotle’s “_Plato amicus sed major amicus veritas_.”

  Bound by family lineage, many and long friendships, historical and
  literary associations, with England, his devotion to our national
  muse of liberty which inspired the constitution and the declaration
  of independence impelled him to openly declare sympathy toward the
  struggling patriots in the Transvaal, as in his long life he has had
  occasion to do for Poland, Hungary, Greece, Cuba and Ireland.

  Gentlemen, there is a higher plane than that of the traditions,
  current methods and policies of organizing colonial dependencies. It
  is to believe that every growing race and ethnic stock has higher
  possibilities in it; to hold that the diverse ways of civilization
  are not all exhausted yet, and that instead of forcing other races
  to take up the white man’s, or the Englishman’s burden, our policy
  should be to keep off, where practicable, alien interference,
  including our own, and to develop a new policy of protection and
  thus to foster new and independent centers of social and political
  development.

  To my mind the tragedy of history is the perversion, repression or
  destruction of budding nationalities of species, and perhaps genera,
  different from our own, and the threatened uniformitization of the
  entire world by civilization as we define and understand it. This is
  the method of what, I think, we may call the higher anthropology. It
  would be, I think, the statesmanship of the superman, who may
  sometime exist, and who would be a citizen of all times and a
  spectator of all events. To steer the ship of state in this
  direction is to keep it true to the pole of human destiny. It is the
  work of the heavenborn pilot, who keeps his tiller true, and not of
  the star gazer.

  These moments are big with destiny. Statesmanship is approaching the
  time when it must take a cosmic view of human life as a whole, and I
  have heard no note that rings so clear and pure to my ear with such
  a true flavor of conviction as the plea for a larger ken by the
  political nestor of this state and nation, who has grown not rich
  but poor from a quarter century’s service for his state; who makes
  no bid for the support of other parties, while speaking as many of
  his colleagues in both parties privately declare they would do if
  they spoke for themselves rather than for their constituency; a man
  competent to-day to fill any one of three if not four
  professorships; whose years admonish us that any such utterance may
  be his last, and whom, as in the case of no other public man, his
  political enemies vie with his friends to honor.

President Hall was followed by President Capen of Tufts College who also
delivered an entertaining address.

The historical paper of the evening was by Thomas F. O’Malley, of
Somerville, Mass., whose subject was “Hugh Cargill,” a patriot who took
part in the events of April 19, 1775. The paper displayed close
research.

There were also addresses during the evening by John E. Milholland,
Joseph Smith and E. O’Meagher Condon.

In accordance with the foregoing notice, a number of members of the

  +------------------------------------------------------------------+

Thomas F. O’Malley then addressed the gathering substantially as
follows:

  To-day we meet in pious and patriotic commemoration of a great deed,
  performed here 125 years ago. To-day we stand in the midst of a
  great nation which is proud, strong and free. All is joy around us.
  But let us turn back a century and a quarter in the book of time.
  What a scene was enacted here! The hill crowned with a hastily
  constructed redoubt and held by an undisciplined and untrained
  yeomanry—farmers, with their fowling pieces and but little
  ammunition.

  A brilliantly appointed army advancing to the attack and storming
  the works, supported by coöperating ships and batteries; the blaze
  of the burning town, coursing whole streets or curling up the spires
  of public edifices; the air above filled with clouds of dense black
  smoke, and the surrounding hills, fields, roofs and steeples
  occupied by crowds of spectators. What strange sounds came to the
  ear—the shouts of the contending armies, the crash of falling
  buildings, the roar of ship guns and mortars and the rattle of
  musketry.

  On one side we find the high courage of men staking their lives and
  reputations on the uncertain issue of a civil war; and on the other,
  the reflection that defeat meant the final loss to Britain of her
  American empire.

  You know the story of that battle—how the flower of England’s army
  were repeatedly repulsed; how in the moment of desperation the
  regulars laid aside their knapsacks, moved forward, relying on the
  bayonet and their artillery to carry the day. The American fire
  slackened, the ammunition was expended, there were no bayonets, and
  the oncoming regulars were met with clubbed muskets and stones. The
  fortunes of the day were reversed, and, technically speaking, it was
  a British victory.

After speaking of the men of Irish blood who fought in the patriot ranks
that day, Mr. O’Malley continued:

  The Americans are estimated to have lost in killed 140, and in
  wounded 271; loss by capture 30. In all, 441. The English loss was
  226 killed, 828 wounded. Total—1,054.

  In comparison with other battles, so far as numbers go, Bunker Hill
  was but a skirmish. But in results it was of the utmost importance.
  Before the engagement there was some hope, perhaps some chance, for
  a peaceful settlement of existing difficulties; but after that
  memorable day, all were for war and independence. Bunker Hill was
  the beginning of the end of British domination on the Western
  continent.

Mr. O’Malley was frequently applauded and upon the conclusion of his
address was warmly congratulated. The banquet at the United States Hotel
in the evening was a most enjoyable affair.

President-General Gargan occupied the chair. Among those present were
Hon. John C. Linehan, treasurer-general of the Society, Concord, N. H.;
Secretary-General T. H. Murray, Woonsocket, R. I.; William Doogue, city
forester of Boston; Thomas F. O’Malley, the orator at the memorial
tablets; Joseph Smith, Lowell, Mass.; James Jeffrey Roche, Boston;
William P. Connery, Lynn, Mass.; M. E. Hennessy, Boston; Capt. Samuel
McKeever, U. S. A. (retired), Somerville, Mass.; E. O’Meagher Condon,
New York city; John T. F. MacDonnell, Holyoke, Mass., and others.

President-General Gargan said in his after-dinner address:

  One hundred and twenty-five years have passed since the memorable
  battle of Bunker Hill, commemorated by yonder tall gray shaft at
  Charlestown, familiar to us all from early boyhood. We knew the
  story of that fight before we knew the multiplication table.
  Nominally a British victory, yet a victory purchased at such fearful
  cost to the victors as to inspire the colonists to believe that
  ultimately the triumph would be theirs.

  We all know the story from the American standpoint; few read the
  British accounts of that battle. I was interested to read, a few
  days ago, some of the English accounts; one of them concludes in
  these words:

  “The action has shown the bravery of the king’s troops, who, under
  every disadvantage, gained a complete victory over three times their
  number strongly posted and covered by breastworks, but they fought
  for their king, their law and constitution.”

  That sounds like the account some of the emasculated Americans in
  our day would give of the fight. But Gage wrote to Lord Dartmouth,
  then minister for the colonies:

  “The number of killed and wounded is greater than we could afford to
  lose. The trials we have had show that the rebels are not the
  despicable rabble too many may have supposed them to be.”

  Burgoyne and Clinton, who saw the battle from Copp’s Hill, have also
  written their impressions of the battle in 1775. There were two
  English accounts, historical in their nature. One of these, it is
  thought, was written by Edmund Burke, and was published in the
  Annual Register of that year.

  To all Americans, Bunker Hill was a battle cry and an inspiration
  during the seven long years of war necessary to obtain our
  independence. To-day its memories should rekindle our patriotism and
  prompt us to recall the story of the men who there died that a new
  republic might be born. We know that they believed in God and had
  high ideals.

The historical paper of the evening was by Hon. John C. Linehan and was
of a high order of merit.

Brief addresses were made by Capt. Samuel McKeever, U. S. A., and by
several other gentlemen present, and the company adjourned, well pleased
with the celebration of the day and evening.




                      THE BATTLE OF RHODE ISLAND.


  ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION OF THE EVENT BY THE SOCIETY, AUG. 29, 1900.

A celebration of the anniversary of the battle of Rhode Island took
place at Newport, R. I., Aug. 29, in accordance with the following
notice, sent to each member:

        RHODE ISLAND CHAPTER, AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

     CELEBRATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF RHODE ISLAND.

  DEAR SIR: The Rhode Island members of the American-Irish Historical
  Society will observe the anniversary of the battle of Rhode Island
  on Wednesday, Aug. 29, 1900.

  The celebration will take place at Newport, R. I., and every member
  of our Society throughout the country is cordially invited to be
  present and participate with us in the exercises of the occasion.

  Headquarters for the day and evening will be established at the
  Aquidneck House, where a reception committee will be in attendance.
  Invitations to be present have been extended the governor of Rhode
  Island, the state record commissioner, and the presidents of the
  Rhode Island and Newport Historical societies.

  During the day many points of historical interest will be visited.
  Dinner will be served at 8 p. m. at the Aquidneck. After dinner,
  patriotic addresses and other appropriate features will take place.

  The battle of Rhode Island, as is well-known, was fought Aug. 29,
  1778, the American forces being commanded by Gen. John Sullivan. In
  this battle Sullivan repulsed the British and maintained the field.
  The anniversary is, therefore, one of note and will, we hope, be
  observed by a very large attendance. Please notify the secretary if
  you intend to be present.

                                  Fraternally,
                          PATRICK J. BOYLE (mayor of Newport),
                              _State Vice-President for Rhode Island_.

  THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY
      (Editor _The Evening Call_, Woonsocket, R. I.),
                                  _Secretary_.
    Aug. 1, 1900.

In response to the foregoing, a number of the members from out of the
state visited Newport and were received by the local members of the
Society. Mayor Boyle presided at the banquet in the evening. He made an
address, as did also Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn.; Hon. James F.
Brennan of Peterborough, N. H.; T. F. O’Malley of Somerville, Mass., and
one or two other gentlemen. A patriotic poem was recited by John J.
Rooney of New York city.

Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary-general of the Society, announced that
since the annual meeting the following members of the organization had
died: Hon. Andrew J. White, New York city; Hon. William F. Reddy,

Washington, D. C.; Eugene T. McCarthy, Lynn, Mass.; Dr. William H.
O’Hearn, Lawrence, Mass.; Daniel B. Kelley, Haverhill, Mass.; William H.
Quinn, Hallowell, Me., and Hon. John J. Hayes, Boston, Mass. Appropriate
tributes were paid the memory of the foregoing and minutes adopted
expressive of esteem and regret.

The accession of the following new members was announced: Michael F.
Cox, M. D., M. R. I. A., of the senate of the Royal University of
Ireland; Hon. James D. Phelan, mayor of San Francisco; Francis Q.
O’Neill, president of the Hibernian Bank, Charleston, S. C.; M. le Comte

It was announced that, in addition to the foregoing, the Knights of St.
Patrick, an influential organization of San Francisco, had joined the
Society in a body and had forwarded their life membership fee.
Congratulations were also announced from the Association Artistique et
Litteraire de Saint-Patrice, of Paris, and a communication was received
from the committee of the Pan Celtic Congress.

The announcement was made, and applauded, that Hon. Edward A. Moseley,
recently president-general of the Society, had been elected to
membership in the Society of the Cincinnati, and that Rev. Joshua P.
Bodfish, of our organization, had been chosen a director of the Bunker
Hill Monument Association.

A communication was read from T. M. Bryan of Montesano, Wash., giving a
sketch of his great-grandfather, John Bryan, an Irishman who came to
this country and served in the patriot ranks during the War of the
Revolution. He is mentioned in the Pennsylvania archives and is believed
to have been at Valley Forge during the terrible winter of 1777‒8.

A letter was also received from Rev. Fred B. Cole, chancellor of the
Protestant Episcopal diocese of Rhode Island, in which he very kindly
offered his services as guide in a contemplated pilgrimage of the
Society to the grave of “Old Parson” MacSparran. Rev. Dr. MacSparran was
an Irishman born toward the close of the seventeenth century, and who
for nearly forty years, was pastor of St. Paul’s church in Narragansett,
R. I. A vote of thanks was tendered Rev. Mr. Cole.

Congratulations were extended the Rev. Austin Dowling, a member of the
Society, on the completion of his history of the Roman Catholic diocese
of Providence, R. I., the same containing much valuable material in the
Society’s line of work.

During the evening, letters regretting their inability to be present
were announced from Governor Gregory of Rhode Island, President Faunce
of Brown University, R. H. Tilley, state record commissioner of Rhode
Island; Hon. John C. Linehan, Concord, N. H.; Joseph Smith, Lowell,
Mass.; Col. D. S. Lamson, Weston, Mass.; James L. O’Neill, Elizabeth, N.
J.; Rev. Owen Kiernan, Fall River, Mass., and from other gentlemen.

The following letter, which had just been received by Secretary T. H.
Murray, aroused special interest when read to the assembled company:

[Illustration: DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION]

  MY DEAR MR. MURRAY:

  Mr. R. H. Tilley has advised me to write you, as a valuable man to
  interest in a project which should be of interest to every loyal
  Rhode Islander.

  The old historic fort on Butts Hill in Portsmouth is being surveyed
  with the idea of selling in small lots, and thus totally
  obliterating the fort where General Sullivan and his troops fought
  so well and so bravely. Does it not seem as if this spot should be
  preserved if possible? I believe a bill was introduced into the
  legislature some time ago, making this fort a state park, but
  nothing has since been heard of it, so far as I can find out.

  Miss Swinburne, regent of William Ellery Chapter, D. A. R., and I
  are very desirous of rousing among the patriotic societies a
  sufficient interest to save this well-preserved relic of
  Revolutionary days. It seems a peculiarly fitting season to begin
  the agitation, and I hope that some of the speakers on Wednesday,
  both at the celebration by your own Historical Society and also at
  the meeting of the Sons of the Revolution on the same day, may feel
  inclined to call attention to this subject.

  I talked with Mr. Tilley[2] yesterday and found him as kindly
  disposed to help as I could desire, and he has promised to add his
  word in support of my request whenever he may chance to see you. I
  can answer for my own Gaspee Chapter, D. A. R., if our assistance is
  needed, but with such influence as you could wield, coöperating with
  the S. A. R and S. R. of the state, I feel very hopeful of success
  in our patriotic project.

  I do not feel as if I had at all adequately presented my case, but
  it is very hard to condense all that might be said on such a subject
  into the limits of a reasonable note. I hope you will recognize my
  endeavor to save your valuable time, and read into my words an
  enthusiastic interest which I have not expressed.

                          Very sincerely yours,
                                  MARGARET B. F. LIPPITT,[3]
                                    _Regent, Gaspee Chapter, D. A. R._

  NEWPORT, R. I., August twenty-sixth.

The following letter on the same topic as the foregoing was received by
Mayor Boyle of Newport, state vice-president of our Society for Rhode
Island:

[Illustration: DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION]

  DEAR SIR:

  At the meeting of the Irish patriotic society to be held on August
  twenty-ninth, to celebrate the battle of Rhode Island, would it be
  possible to bring up the subject of the old fortifications on Butts
  Hill and call attention to the danger which threatens them, namely,
  their destruction?

  Few such spots remain on this island, and is it not the duty as well
  as privilege of all loyal patriots to help preserve such spots where
  our forefathers so hardly fought and whose names we honor and
  revere?

  I hope this may receive your support and that you will consider it
  of sufficient importance to bring before your society.

                    Yours very truly,
                                      SUSAN P. SWINBURNE,
                            _Regent, William Ellery Chapter, D. A. R._

  August twenty-eight,
                 245 Broadway, Newport, R. I.

Butts Hill, to which Mrs. Lippitt and Miss Swinburne refer, is in
Portsmouth, R. I. The fortifications alluded to were constructed by Gen.
John Sullivan in 1778, in connection with the siege of Newport and the
subsequent battle on Rhode Island.

The meeting expressed itself as heartily in favor of the project
mentioned in the two letters and referred the subject-matter to the
executive council of the Society.

On the same evening that this celebration of the battle anniversary was
being held by our members at the Aquidneck, another celebration of the
anniversary was taking place at the Newport Casino, under the auspices
of the Newport Sons of the Revolution.

During the evening, greetings were sent by the Sons assembled at the
Casino to our members at the Aquidneck. Messrs. Sanborn and Garrettson
of Newport, and Lieutenant Commander Murdock, U. S. N., were delegated
to proceed to the Aquidneck and present our members a handsome floral
tribute. The presentation speech was made by Mr. Garrettson, and the
tribute was accepted, on behalf of our Society, by Mayor Boyle. Later,
several of our members accepted an invitation from the Sons to be their
guests, and proceeded to the Casino, where they were warmly greeted and
hospitably entertained.

John P. Sanborn of the Sons, who was then presiding, paid a glowing
tribute to Gen. John Sullivan and to the Irish element, generally, in
American history. While at the Casino, several of our members were
called on for remarks and responded. Thus Mayor Boyle made a brief
address, as did Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn. John J. Rooney of New
York recited a patriotic poem, and Hon. James F. Brennan of
Peterborough, N. H., spoke eloquently of the services of General
Sullivan.




                          PAPERS OF THE YEAR.

     READ BY MEMBERS AT MEETINGS OF THE SOCIETY, OR CONTRIBUTED FOR
                      PUBLICATION IN THIS VOLUME.




  REV. JAMES MAC SPARRAN, IRISHMAN, SCHOLAR, PREACHER AND PHILOSOPHER,
                               1680‒1757.

                     BY THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY.[4]


Rev. James MacSparran was one of the great men given by Ireland to Rhode
Island in the early half of the eighteenth century. For nearly forty
years he was rector of St. Paul’s church,[5] in Narragansett, R. I., and
forms one of the grand figures in Rhode Island history.

He was born in or near Dungiven, Londonderry, Ireland, about the year
1680. He received the degree of M. A. from Glasgow University in 1709,
and that of D. D., from Oxford in 1731. He belonged to a Presbyterian
family. His first visit within the present territory of Rhode Island was
made about 1718.

He came from Boston to Bristol, then a part of Massachusetts, and
stopped during his visit at the house of a relative, the Widow
Pompelion, who resided at the corner of Hope and State streets.
Possessing credentials as a licentiate, he preached in Bristol and was
favorably received. Munro thus narrates[6] the incident:

“The pulpit was vacant, and the young Irishman was invited to preach in
the meeting house on the Sunday after he reached Bristol. Mr. M^cSparran
possessed, in an unusual degree, the remarkable eloquence with which so
many of the children of Ireland have been endowed, and his wonderful
oratory made such a deep impression upon the minds of his hearers that
at a church meeting held on the 16th of December, 1718, he was invited
to settle in the town as its pastor. On the 22d of December the town
concurred in the church’s choice, 73 votes being cast for Mr. M^cSparran
and but three against him.”

It was voted that his salary be £100 per year, and £100 was appropriated
toward the expense of his settlement. Thus far matters had gone along
smoothly. Trouble now arose, however. A date had been fixed for his
ordination, but the ministers who were expected to officiate refused to
do so.

MacSparran[7] being desirous of a settlement, offered to submit to lay
ordination. In the meantime, Rev. Dr. Mather of Massachusetts had
instituted charges against him. One of these was “Unguarded
conversation.” The matter came before a town-meeting in May, 1719, and
MacSparran was exonerated. Angered by their defeat, his opponents then
questioned the genuineness of his credentials. In order to give him an
opportunity to establish his standing, the town:

“Voted, That leave be granted to Mr. James MacSparran, our present
minister, to take a voyage to Ireland, in order to procure a
confirmation of his credentials, the truth of which being by some
questioned; and that he return to us again some time in June next
ensuing and proceed in the work of the ministry with us, if he procure
the confirmation of the aforesaid credentials.”

MacSparran departed, but never returned to that church or denomination.
The harsh and illiberal treatment he had received from Mather and other
zealots displeased him, and soon after he entered the Church of England,
in which he remained until his death.

MacSparran came to these parts again in 1721, this time as a Church of
England missionary. He began his ministerial labors at St. Paul’s church
in Narragansett (Kingstown, R. I.), and had charge of that colonial
parish until his death in 1757. The settlers in that neighborhood had
been visited by two ministers previous to Dr. MacSparran’s coming, but,
as he declares, “they lacked resolution to grapple with the difficulties
of the mission above a year apiece.”

MacSparran married Miss Hannah Gardiner, daughter of William Gardiner,
on May 22, 1722. The ceremony was performed in St. Paul’s church,
Narragansett, by Rev. Samuel Honeyman, who had gone from Newport for the
purpose. Dr. MacSparran was proud to be known as an Irishman. He could
write and speak the Irish language, and always had a great affection for
his native land. He was a kindly, noble-hearted man, and could, when
occasion required, eloquently defend his Roman Catholic
fellow-countrymen.

His very interesting work, “America Dissected,” was published at Dublin
in 1753. It gives us a good idea of the extent of Irish immigration and
of other matters in the colonies at that time. The work comprises
letters addressed by Dr. MacSparran from Narragansett “in the colony of
Rhode Island” to friends in Ireland. Here are extracts from one written
by him to Col. Henry Cary, under date of August, 1752:

“There has lately been made, upon and behind the mountains of Virginia,
a new Irish settlement, by a transmigration of sundry of those that,
within these thirty years past, went from the north of Ireland to
Pennsylvania. As the soil in that new Irish settlement is natural and
friendly to grass, they will for many years to come raise great
quantities of neat cattle.”

Writing of Maryland he says: “As the late Lord Baltimore was the first
Protestant peer of the Calvert family, his predecessors (as it was
natural they should) first peopled this province with a colony of Irish
Catholics.... There are some Quakers here, in consequence of its
bordering on Pennsylvania, and some Irish Presbyterians, owing to the
swarms that, for many years past, have winged their way westward out of
the great Hibernian hive.”

Again referring to Pennsylvania, Dr. MacSparran writes: “The Irish are
numerous in this province, who, besides their interspersions among the
English and others, have peopled a whole county by themselves, called
the county of _Donnegal_, with many other new out-towns and districts.
In one of these frontiers, on the forks of Delaware, I assisted my
brother (who left Ireland against my advice) in purchasing a large tract
of land, which by his wife’s demise, above a year ago, descends to his
children. The exportations from this province are principally wheaten
flour, which they send abroad in great quantities; and by the accessions
and industry of the Irish and Germans, they threaten, in a few years, to
lessen the American demands for Irish and other European linens.”

Alluding to New Hampshire he continues: “In this province lies that town
called London-Derry, all Irish, and famed for industry and riches.”

Then, leaving New Hampshire, he continues: “Next you enter Main,[8]
which in its civilized government, is annexed to the Massachusetts, as
Sagadahock also is; and both rather by use than right. In these two
eastern provinces many Irish are settled, and many have been ruined by
the French Indians and drove from their homes. It is pretty true to
observe of the Irish,[9] that those who come here with any wealth, are
the worse for their removal; though, doubtless, the next generation will
not suffer so much as their fathers; but those who, when they came, had
nothing to lose, have throve greatly by their labour.”

Dr. MacSparran’s reference to Rhode Island is of particular interest. He
writes of it as follows: “... the little colony of Rhode Island, etc.,
where Providence has fixed me, and where I have resided in quality of
missionary thirty-one years last April.... This little district extends
itself no more than forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth, or it
may be forty [for I write to you, sir, from memory]. It contains
1,024,000 acres, and is peopled with about 30,000 inhabitants, young and
old, white and black.... In 1700, after Quakerism and other heresies
had, in their turn, ruled and tinged all the inhabitants for the space
of forty-six years, the Church of England, that had been lost here
through the neglect of the crown, entered, as it were, unobserved and
unseen, and yet not without some success.

“A little church was built in Newport, the metropolis of the colony, in
1702, and that in which I officiate in Narragansett, in 1707.... I
entered on this mission in 1721, and found the people not a ... clean
sheet of paper, upon which I might make any impressions I pleased; but a
field full of briars and thorns, and noxious weeds, that were all to be
eradicated, before I could implant in them the simplicity of truth. By
my excursions and out labours, a church is built 25 miles to the
westward of me, but not now under my care; another 16 miles to the
northward of me, where I officiate once a month; and at a place six
miles further off, on the Saturday before that monthly Sunday. I
gathered a congregation at a place called New Bristol, where now
officiates a missionary from the Society, and I was the first Episcopal
minister that ever preached at Providence, where, for a long time, I
used to go four times a year, but that church has now a fixed missionary
of its own.”

In another place he tells us: “There are above three hundred vessels,
such as sloops, schooners, brigantines, and ships, from sixty tons and
upwards, that belong to this colony, and they are carriers for other
colonies.”

The church of St. Paul was built in 1707. When Kingstown was divided, in
1722, into the towns of North and South Kingstown, the church became
located about a mile over the line in the former place. In 1791 it was
incorporated as St. Paul’s church in North Kingstown. In 1800 the
building was removed to Wickford and the parish divided.

Dr. MacSparran was for nearly four decades closely identified with the
highest social and intellectual life of the colony. His scholarly
attainments made him the centre of a group[10] of cultivated minds. As
pastor of St. Paul’s church, he ministered to many of the leading
families in Rhode Island. He officiated at their weddings, administered
baptism, preached the gospel according to his convictions, and when
loved ones died uttered sweet words of condolence, sympathy and hope.

The church records contain such leading names as Updike, Arnold,
Lippitt, Gardiner, Helme, Wilkinson, Potter, Robinson and a large number
of others.

But “Parson” MacSparran, as he was lovingly called, was not alone the
friend and associate of the well-to-do. His love for the poor and lowly
was unbounded, and this sympathy found ample reciprocation in the hearts
of the humble.

In order to understand the general character of Narragansett society at
that period a few words may be necessary. Amos Perry[11] says: “The
honor of being, par excellence, the Narragansett country is generally
conceded to Charlestown and the original ‘Kings Towne,’ whose united
area is 19.8 per cent. of that of the entire state.” To make it plainer,
it should be said that the “Narragansett country” comprised that portion
of the state of Rhode Island now known as Washington county. It was so
called because it was the seat of the Narragansett Indians.[12] In 1654
it was named King’s Province, which in 1729 was changed to King’s
county. In 1781 that monarchical designation was dropped and the name
Washington substituted.

The county now comprises the towns of Charlestown, Exeter, Hopkinton,
North Kingstown, South Kingstown, Richmond, and Westerly. The
“Narragansett country” had long existed as an independent jurisdiction.
Finally, the king in council promulgated his decision uniting the
“King’s Province or Narragansett” to Rhode Island. For long years after,
the name “Narragansett country” was still affectionately retained in the
nomenclature of that district. In Dr. MacSparran’s time there were
numbers of wealthy landholders in Narragansett. Many of these owned
thousands of acres each and had great herds of cattle and flocks of
sheep. Many, too, were slave owners and slave dealers. As late as 1804,
Rhode Island had fifty-nine vessels engaged in the slave trade,
notwithstanding an act was passed in 1787 forbidding the traffic.[13]

For a long period the slaves were practically barred out of the church.
They were neither instructed, baptized, nor admitted to the communion.
To bestow such favors upon them was considered inconsistent by their
masters. But MacSparran, the great-hearted Irishman, combated this
error. He emphatically protested against this unchristian exclusion of
the slaves and ultimately prevailed in their behalf.

The Narragansett landholders and their families lived in princely style
on their vast estates. They were a hospitable race, cordial in their
welcomes, warm and lasting in their attachments. Fond of horse racing,
they raised a breed known as “Narragansett Pacers,” which became famous
throughout the country. Fox-hunting was also a favorite sport.

The glebe house occupied by Dr. MacSparran for over thirty years is yet
standing. It overlooks the Pettaquamscutt river. This river is really a
connected series of pretty lakes. Mr. Hazard once termed them the
“Killarneys of New England.” Dr. MacSparran taught many pupils at his
home, imparting a knowledge of the Greek and Latin classics and various
other branches. Writing in 1752, he says: “Mr. Thomas Clap, president of
Yale college, was my scholar when I came first to these parts, and on
all occasions gratefully acknowledges his receiving the first rudiments
of his learning from me, who, by the way, have not but a modicum to
boast of myself.” Dr. MacSparran has left this significant entry: “In
Bristol, New England, February 5th, 1722, were imprisoned in jail twelve
men of the Church of England for refusing to pay for the support of the
Presbyterian teacher, viz.: Mr. Nathaniel Cotton.” Others were
imprisoned in 1724 for a like offense, and Dr. MacSparran says: “I have
inserted this line in the church records, that the age to come may not
forget the opposing spirit of New England Presbyterians.” The following
extracts from the records of St. Paul’s church may prove of interest:

“July 11, 1721, four children were baptized at Providence, viz.: Mary
Bernon, and Eva Bernon, Anna Donnison, and Elizabeth Donnison, by Rev.
Mr. McSparran.

“November 8th, 1724. Captain Benoni Sweet was baptized at St. Paul’s, in
Narragansett, by the Rev. Mr. McSparran.

“April 22d, 1730. In Westerly, Narragansett, Christopher Champlin and
Hannah Hill, daughter of Captain John Hill, were joined together in holy
matrimony by the Rev. Mr. McSparran, at the house of the said Captain
John Hill.

“May 2d, 1730. Daniel Updike, Attorney-General of the Colony and
Lieutenant-Colonel of the militia of the Islands, was baptized by
immersion (in Petaquamscut river) by the Rev. Mr. McSparran, in presence
of Mr. McSparran, Hannah McSparran, his wife, and Josiah Arnold, church
warden, as witnesses.

“December 11th, 1735. Dr. Giles Goddard[14] of Groton, in Connecticut,
was married to Miss Sarah Updike, at the house of her father, Captain
Lodowick Updike, by Mr. McSparran.

“August 6, 1747. Dr. McSparran baptized Mrs. Elizabeth Wilkinson, wife
of Capt. Philip Wilkinson,[15] by immersion in Petaquamscut pond.
Witnesses, the Doctor, his wife, and Mrs. Coddington.

“Sept. 6th, Thursday, 1750. The bans of marriage being duly published at
the church of St. Paul’s, in Narragansett, no objections being made,
John Anthony, an Indian man, was married to Sarah George, an Indian
woman, the widow and Dowager Queen of Geo. Augustus Ninegret, deceased,
by Dr. McSparran.

“Nov. 18, 1750. Sunday, the banns being first duly asked, at St. Paul’s,
Dr. McSparran married William Potter, youngest son of Col. John Potter,
to Penelope Hazard, eldest daughter of Col. Thomas Hazard, both of South
Kingstown, at Col. Thomas Hazard’s house.

“Nov. 7, 1752. Dr. McSparran, at the house of Colonel Thomas Hazard, on
Boston Neck,[16] married George Hazard (son of George, the son of old
Thomas Hazard) to Sarah Hazard, the third daughter of said Colonel
Hazard.

“April 11th, 1756, being Palm Sunday, Doctor McSparran read prayers,
preached, and baptized a child named Gilbert Stewart,[17] son of Gilbert
Stewart, the snuff-grinder. Sureties, the Doctor, Mr. Benjamin Mumford,
and Mrs. Hannah Mumford.”

In 1741‒2, MacSparran in a letter to the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Foreign Parts, writes that in the middle arm of the sea,
which divides the island of Rhode Island from the Narragansett shore,
lies an island called Conanicut, “about eight or nine miles long, and
two wide, containing about four or five hundred inhabitants, who had
never had Christianity preached to them in any shape than Quakerism,”
until he addressed them upon express invitation. He was so pleased with
his first visit to the island that he determined to repeat the visit
monthly. In the course of his letters he expresses the wish that Ireland
was at liberty to send the colonies her woolens instead of her linens,
“which will soon cease to be in demand here.”

MacSparran was unalterably opposed, in season and out of season, to all
efforts to form a legislative union between England and Ireland. He
gives expression to his sentiments on this point, in a letter to
Ireland,[18] wherein he declares:

“Our attention has for some time been taken up with the news of measures
on foot to unite Ireland to England, as Scotland is. I pray God they may
never take effect; for if they do, farewell liberty. You are greater
slaves already than our negroes, and an union of that kind would make
you more underlings than you are now. The accounts of the open
irreligion of the greater island inclines me to imagine, that Ireland is
on the brink of obtaining (as if these accounts are true, it deserves),
its ancient name of Insula Sanctorum. But if ever you come into a closer
connection with the more eastern island, corruption will increase.... I
suppose those that are sent to rule with you, like those who sometimes
are sent here, imagine fleecing to be a better business than feeding the
flock. The revolution which happened before you and I were born, might
be thought a wise and necessary measure, but we see it has been followed
with some bad consequences. To get free from Popery, we have run into
infidelity and scepticism.... Except the little revival religion had in
Queen Ann’s reign, the church has gained no ground, but in America,
since that period.”

Dr. MacSparran, in a letter addressed[19] to a friend in Ireland under
date of 1752, again refers to Rhode Island, saying: “There are here,
which is no good symptom, a vast many law suits, more in one year than
the county of Derry has in twenty ... and Billy McEvers has been so long
your father’s and your honor’s constable, that he would make a very good
figure on the bench of our courts of sessions and of common pleas, and
no contemptible one on those of our courts of assize and general gaol
delivery.”

Writing to his friend William Stevenson, in Ireland, Aug. 21, 1752,
MacSparran informs him that “My brother and his wife died a year ago
last June.... I have to go for England for ten or twelve months, to go
to the baths for better health; if I can bring matters to bear to get to
England, my next push will be to be seated in Ireland.... I am in the
hands of a good God, who has the hearts of men at command; and if he
sees that I can serve the interests of Christ’s church, either in the
use of the English or Irish language, which you know I can write and
read, and upon occasion could preach in, He will raise me up friends,
and restore me to my native land, or near it—if not, His will be done.”

Dr. MacSparran’s brother, whom he mentions, Archibald, sailed from
Ireland for Rhode Island, but the ship made another port and he settled
near New Castle on Delaware bay. He had seven children: Margaret, Eliza,
Bridget, John, James, Archibald, and Joseph. Dr. MacSparran, as I have
said, had no children. The Doctor and his wife went to England sometime
before 1755. She died there in the latter year.

The Doctor returned to Rhode Island and made pastoral visits to
Providence, Warwick and several other places. In 1757 he died.[20] The
manner of his death was a little remarkable. It is thus described in
papers in the possession of the Updike family:

“Dr. MacSparran caught his death at father’s. He went to prayer, and had
read and was going to kneel, and being a fat, heavy man, and putting his
hands on the table to ease himself down, the table split off and his
weight came down and he hit the edge of his eyebrow against the sharp
edge of the table leg and he bled profusely—but he would have nothing
done till he had finished his prayer. They bound it up and he got home
and never recovered.”

He was buried under the communion table of St. Paul’s. In 1781 his
successor, Rev. Samuel Fayerweather, was laid beside him. It is believed
that Dr. MacSparran had written a history of Narragansett, but the
manuscript was not found after his death. It may have previously been
sent to Ireland. He bequeathed his house and farm to church purposes and
the property became a glebe for the rectors of St. Paul’s.

Sometime previous to his death he sent his diplomas as Master and Doctor
to Rev. Paul Limrick, a cousin in Ireland, requesting the latter to have
them registered in the parish registry of Dungiven. He asked to have
this done “not through vanity, but being a pilgrim on earth and not
knowing but my _carcase_ may fall in a strange land, it would be
pleasing to me that my relations in time to come might be able to speak
of me with authority.”




MEN OF IRISH BLOOD WHO HAVE ATTAINED DISTINCTION IN AMERICAN JOURNALISM.

                    BY MICHAEL EDMUND HENNESSY.[21]


In journalism, as in every other walk of life, men of Irish blood are,
and have been, leaders of those who mould public opinion. As American
newspaper men, Irish-Americans have added new laurels to the fair name
of Erin’s sons. Irish in name, their intense Americanism pervades every
cosmopolitan journal from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the
Canadian line to the Gulf of Mexico.

Irishmen were among the pioneers in the establishment of the early
American newspapers. It would, indeed, be interesting to follow one by
one, step by step, the career of the men of Irish blood who, more than a
hundred years ago, braved blind prejudice and established newspapers
which did so much for American freedom, and later labored so hard for
internal improvements, the developing and the upbuilding of the great
Republic.

Irishmen were among the first paper manufacturers in this country. Many
of them, prior to the Revolutionary War, were engaged in the printing
business. Naturally they drifted into publishing newspapers. At the
period immediately following the Revolution, it is estimated by the
census bureau that there were published in the United States two hundred
papers. Of these, it is said, twenty-five were controlled by foreigners,
and were, as a rule, the most influential papers published, and were
issued in the large towns like Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

The election of John Adams as president, and the inauguration of his
federal policy, brought into being a strong opposition press, which
arrayed itself on the side of Thomas Jefferson. The editors of that
period, not unlike the politicians of their time, did not mince matters.
Their trenchant quills smote the Federalists with such force that the
administration of Mr. Adams deemed it necessary to pass a law that would
curb the spirit of the times and muzzle the opposition press. The result
was the enactment of the Alien and Sedition act. The twenty-five papers
which were controlled by the foreigners were the special mark of the
alien and sedition laws.

Appleton’s Encyclopedia, speaking on this subject, says:

“The apology for the sedition act was the unquestionable licentiousness
of the press, which, at that time, was chiefly controlled by refugees
and adventurists from Great Britain and Ireland.”

Lossing, in his United States History, says, “that outside of New
England, the most influential papers were controlled principally by
foreigners.”

The majority of the refugees and adventurists, so called, were men of
Irish blood; all of them men of learning, enterprise and push. They
hated the Federalists for their pro-English leanings, especially
President Adams, whom they believed to be friendly to England in the
contest against France. Several of them had had a taste of British
tyranny at home, and all were imbued with the spirit of ’98.

Among the very earliest newspaper enterprises was that of Hugh Gaine in
New York city. Gaine was a native of Ireland. He began his new world
career as a book-seller. In 1752 he commenced the publication of the
_Mercury_. Hudson, in his history of journalism in the United States,
says of the paper, that it was one of the best in all the colonies in
the collection of intelligence. Hugh Gaine prospered as an editor,
book-seller and publisher.

How noble was the attitude of Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, who lent
his mighty influence to launching the _Maryland Gazette_. His financial
and moral aid made possible its vigorous contest for the freedom of the
colonies.

The alien and sedition act was particularly aimed at the Irishmen, who,
almost to a man, arrayed themselves under the broad banner of Jefferson,
the leader of the Republicans. The first man to suffer under the alien
and sedition laws was an Irishman, Congressman Matthew Lyon of Vermont,
a native of Wicklow, a printer, who started the _Farmer’s Library_, and
later issued the _Fairhaven Gazette_. This “peppery, red-headed little
Irishman,” as he was called by his contemporaries, hated everything that
had the odor of Federalism about it, and for an article written by him,
published in a Vermont paper, reflecting on President John Adams, he was
indicted by the United States Court. A writer, speaking of the article
for which he was indicted, says that “the language was decidedly
Lyonesque.” He was fined $1,000 and imprisoned for three months. While
in jail he was reëlected to congress, and on his release would have been
rearrested on another charge under the same act, had he not availed
himself of his constitutional rights and declared that he was on his way
to Philadelphia to attend a sitting of Congress.

Lyon is remembered for his varied congressional life, and the episode
especially with Congressman Griswold of Connecticut. Griswold referred
to Lyon deprecatingly one day, and revived an old story of alleged
cowardice during the Revolutionary War, which his political opponents
used against him. The result was an exhibition of old-time pugilism on
the floor of congress. For this offence an attempt was made to expel him
from the house on two occasions, but each time it failed for want of a
two-thirds vote.

Lyon had the distinguished honor of having been elected as a
representative from three states to congress,—Vermont, Kentucky and
Arkansas. He learned the trade of a printer when a boy, ran away from
the old country and settled in Vermont. Governor Chittenden took a great
interest in the young Irish lad, and helped him in many ways. He married
a daughter of the governor’s, and engaged in the manufacture of iron and
paper. Becoming involved financially, in trying to build a flotilla of
gunboats on the Delaware for the infant American navy, he moved to
Kentucky, and there set up another printing office, the first in the
state. He was elected to Congress in 1804, serving until 1810.

He was the first delegate to Congress from Arkansas, having taken up his
residence in Little Rock, but he died before taking his seat. To Matthew
Lyon also belongs the distinguished honor of having cast the vote of
Vermont for Jefferson for president against Adams in that critical
period of American history, when the choice of president was thrown into
the house of representatives.

His son, Chittenden, was a prominent man of his day, a member of
congress, and took an active part in public affairs. In 1840 congress
refunded Matthew Lyon’s son the $1,000 fine imposed upon his father
under the alien and sedition act.

In Massachusetts, Attorney-General James Sullivan, afterward congressman
and governor, the son of Irish emigrants, wrote and published a most
able paper entitled, “A Dissertation on the Constitutional Freedom of
the Press,” severely arraigning the sedition law. After enumerating the
power of congress, Mr. Sullivan said:

“It is very clear that, considering a libel as a private injury, the
congress can have no authority to enact a law for its definition or
punishment.... It went beyond what the constitution would warrant.” In
his final summing up, Attorney-General Sullivan said, “that a
reasonable, constitutional restraint, judicially exercised, is the only
way in which the freedom of the press can be preserved as an invaluable
privilege to the nation.”

The alien and sedition laws were soon effaced from the statute books
when the Democratic party came into power under Jefferson. Inasmuch as
these laws were aimed especially at the men of Irish blood, who sought
freedom at home in vain and came here to enjoy it, it was especially
fitting that an Irishman, Senator Smilie of South Carolina, should
introduce the bill for their repeal. He was chairman of the committee on
foreign affairs on the part of the senate.

John T. Morse, in his “American Statesmen” series, characterizes the
alien and sedition laws as the “two great blunders of the Federal
party,” and adds: “No one has ever been able heartily or successfully to
defend these foolish outbursts of ill-considered legislation.”

Another Irishman, John Daly Burk of _The Time-Piece_ published in New
York city was arrested under the alien and sedition law. This John Daly
Burk had a most interesting history. He published the first daily paper
in Boston. Said to be of the same family as the great Edmund Burke, he
was expelled from Trinity College, Dublin, for patriotic articles
contributed to the _Dublin Evening Post_, a paper which advocated the
cause of the people against the rule of England. The expulsion of young
Burk from Trinity only rekindled his patriotism and he rallied around
the young band of patriots who were getting ready for the uprising of
’98. A brother patriot was being led to the gallows one day. As the
procession passed Trinity’s steps, where Burk, in company with about
thirty young men, was standing, he called out that if there was an
Irishman in
