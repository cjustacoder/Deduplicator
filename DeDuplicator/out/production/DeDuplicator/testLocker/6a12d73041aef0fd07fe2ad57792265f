 be unevenly divided. In the equal
partnerships, each partner has the same financial interest and share in
the profits, and also the same right of control. In other partnerships,
the financial investment or interests are unevenly divided; and the
one who holds more than half interest controls the business, unless
otherwise provided for in the partnership agreement. Partners may be
in name only, and not own any of the property. Active partners are
those who give practically all of their time to the conducting of the
business. Silent partners are not likely to take any active part in the
management of the business, but they may control it, if their financial
interest is sufficient. Under common law, no partner has a right to
engage in any other business which would injure the partnership, unless
permitted to do so by the other partners. The acts of one partner bind
all of the rest. If one partner commits fraud in the name of the firm,
the others are financially responsible, although they may have had no
knowledge of his action. The partnership or business may or may not
be liable for the private debts of any one partner. Usually a partner
cannot be held for more than his interest in the firm. Partnerships
may be dissolved by mutual agreement or by judicial act, and it is
usual to publish the dissolution of partnership in one or more of the
local newspapers, and to send notices of it to the trade. A limited
partnership does not hold any partner or the concern itself liable for
more than the amount of the property in the business, but a partnership
will not be considered limited unless it is publicly announced.


Patent Medicines

It has been said, and with some degree of truth, that Americans are
self-dosers, and that they are prone to attempt to cure themselves,
even of serious diseases, without consulting a physician.

The sale of patent medicines is enormous, although I think it is
diminishing in volume, due to the exposures which have appeared in many
periodicals, and to the better education of the people.

A patent medicine, technically speaking, is a concoction or drug, or
combination of drugs, claimed to be a remedy or cure for a specific
ill or for all of the ills that the human flesh is heir to. It is
manufactured in large quantities, and bottled or put up with attractive
labels, with more or less directions given for its use. Many of the
patent medicines are either absolutely ineffective or are positively
dangerous. Many of them contain a large percentage of alcohol, which
acts as a transient tonic, and produces an exhilaration which the
sufferer is likely to consider beneficial. The effect of the alcohol
soon wears off, and the taker is much worse for having swallowed it.

Other patent medicines contain cocaine and other dangerous drugs,
which never should be taken without the advice of a physician. The
effect of some patent medicines is likely to be immediate and to appear
to be efficacious. Some patent medicines, however, are made of pure
drugs, and are really valuable. I am, however, opposed to the use of
patent medicines, even of those which are carefully and scientifically
compounded.

It is obvious that the layman cannot diagnose his trouble, and the
label on the bottle, or the pamphlet accompanying it, is likely to
confuse him, and in many cases makes him feel that he is suffering from
an ailment or disease which does not exist.

Headache powders, cough medicines, tonics of all kinds, soothing syrup
for babies, should be conscientiously avoided, unless prescribed by a
physician. They are likely to contain dangerous drugs, and may have no
medicinal properties at all.

Because a certain medicine has worked well with one person should
not be taken as evidence that another can take it to his advantage.
Similar symptoms may exist, and yet the root of the trouble be entirely
different.

Even if every patent medicine were pure and scientifically compounded,
I would advise against their use, unless recommended by a physician,
who is likely to diagnose correctly the trouble and to apply the right
remedy.

Physicians are not infallible, but every reputable physician is a
graduate of a medical school, a reader of current medical magazines,
and is constantly in touch, by experience, with other physicians and
with human ailments. Even if he is not an expert, his close proximity
to disease makes him far more reliable than the label on the medicine
bottle.

I would advise no one to place himself in the hands of any physician
who is not a member of one of the great medical associations,
maintained by both the allopathic and homeopathic schools.

These associations will not admit into membership any one who has not
been properly instructed, and who is not reliable. Any physician of
standing, and with a sufficient knowledge of the human body, can obtain
membership in these associations, and those who are not members may be
looked upon with suspicion, although it is quite likely that some of
them are reliable; but as they are outside of the associations, they
cannot have the facilities of consultation and experience, which are
given to those in regular standing in an association.

It is obvious that one of even ordinary ability, who is educated in
the profession, is more reliable than one who doctors by his wits,
even though he may appear to be successful. Although there are some
charlatans in the profession, who practice in their own interest more
than in that of their patients, the average physician represents
the highest order of civilization. He knows at the start that his
profession is not likely to bring him heavy financial return. He
goes into it with his eyes open. He is under the strictest rules and
regulations, and cannot maintain his standing in the associations, or
with the public, if he does not practice legitimately. He has every
facility at his command, and although he is not always successful, he
is far better able to produce results than is one who has not been
properly educated, and who lacks experience and association with
other doctors, and who has not had hospital practice. Every reputable
physician has not only graduated from a medical school, but was given
opportunity to practice in hospitals and elsewhere before he became a
family physician. The so-called specialist began as a family physician,
and gives his time somewhat exclusively to one disease or to surgery.
The surgeon, while a regular physician, specializes in surgery, and
comparatively few family practitioners will handle a serious surgical
case, except in emergencies. They refer the patient to the skilled
surgeon.

The physician is both a curer and preventor of disease. I would advise
every one, no matter how healthy he may be, to consult a reputable
physician once a year, and to be overhauled, so to speak. Most troubles
can be obviated if taken in time. A symptom seemingly serious to the
one having it may be of little consequence, and yet it may be the
forerunner of an incurable disease. If a good physician is consulted
in time, he may either obviate the trouble or prevent its rapid
increase. No one should attempt to diagnose his own condition. Even
the physician will not do so for himself, because no one can tell by
his feelings exactly what is the matter with him or what would better
be done. The physician when sick, consults other physicians, if his
trouble is of any seriousness. The expense of an annual examination
need not exceed two or three dollars, and some physicians will make
it for a dollar. They are likely to locate any trouble, although it
may have just appeared and the symptom be slight. They will prescribe
a treatment, which cannot fail to be of benefit to those who consult
them. Therefore, I say, visit a good physician at least once a year,
irrespective of your health.

In every city, and in many of the towns, are practicing alleged
physicians or doctors, who claim to be unusually expert and able to
cure where others fail, or even to cure what cannot be cured. Some of
them are graduates of medical schools, and are really good physicians,
but most of them are irresponsible and without real ability. Their
method frequently makes the patient feel that he is being cured, and
cured rapidly. They use appliances and drugs which have an immediate
effect, usually to the patients' injury; or they practice the same as
regular physicians do and give the patient false encouragement. It
seems to me obvious that no so-called outside practitioner, who is not
a member of the associations, can possibly possess any information or
know of any method of treatment with which the regular physicians are
unfamiliar. These charlatans play upon the feelings of the patient,
and it is said that some of them keep him sick for financial reasons.
Therefore, I warn the reader against any physician who is not a member
of one of the two great associations, and who is not recognized by the
profession at large. Even though some of them are skillful, it is safer
to employ a physician of standing than to take one who makes a business
of practicing, and who is not answerable to the rules and regulations
enforced by the associations, and who cannot, because of his removal
from them, obtain and enjoy the privilege of consultation with other
members of his craft. Do not take chances with your body. Better risk
the few mistakes made by physicians than by your own doctor.


=Perpetual Motion.=--Scientists, particularly early ones, made frantic
and continuous endeavors to invent what was supposed to be perpetual
motion; that is, a machine which will keep perpetually in motion
without being replenished or supplied with outside energy. About 60
years ago scientific bodies refused to consider it, as it was proved
to be impossible. The "Scientific American," many years ago, likened
perpetual motion to an energy which will permit a man to lift himself
by his boot-straps.


=Petroleum Industry.=--The annual production is considerably more than
9,000,000,000 gallons a year.


=Philippine Islands.=--The Philippine Islands consist of over 3,000
islands, having an area of about 115,000 square miles. The population
exceeds 7,500,000; and the density of population is about 67 to the
square mile, as against 26 to the square mile in the United States. The
climate is tropical.


=Pianoforte.=--The piano or pianoforte is said to have been invented in
Italy and to have appeared in 1714. Germany, however, claims the honor
of its invention. It was introduced into England in 1766.


=Plate Glass.=--The sand, out of which glass is made, is melted until
it is of about the consistency of molasses. It is then poured into a
casting trough or a table mounted on wheels so it can be run close to
the mouth of the furnace. The molten glass is poured into the trough
through a sluice-way, and before it hardens, heavy rollers pass over
it, reducing it to the required thickness. It is rolled to about 9-16
of an inch, and then by further rolling and polishing it is reduced to
the required thickness. It further passes through a smelting oven which
thoroughly hardens it. Then, it is again polished.


=Playing Cards.=--The origin is unknown, although they appeared in
Europe in 1350. It is claimed that the Arabs used playing cards at a
much earlier date. It is estimated that over sixteen million packs of
playing cards are made annually in the United States.


=Pole Star.=--This is a star of the second magnitude, found at the
extremity of the handle of the Little Dipper.

Population Per Square Mile

=Continental United States.=--The following summary shows, for
continental United States, the total population, land area in square
miles, and population per square mile of land area at each census from
1790 to 1910, inclusive:

                            Land area  Population
  Census Year   Population   (square      per
                              miles)    sq. mile

  1910          91,972,266  2,973,890    30.9
  1900          75,994,575  2,974,159    25.6
  1890          62,947,714  2,973,965    21.2
  1880          50,155,783  2,973,965    16.9
  1870          38,558,371  2,973,965    13.0
  1860          31,443,321  2,973,965    10.6
  1850          23,191,876  2,944,337     7.9
  1840          17,069,453  1,753,588     9.7
  1830          12,866,020  1,753,588     7.3
  1820           9,638,453  1,753,588     5.5
  1810           7,239,881  1,685,865     4.3
  1800           5,308,483    867,980     6.1
  1790           3,929,214    867,980     4.5

According to the census of 1910, there are in continental United
States, on the average, 30.9 inhabitants to each square mile of land
area, or nearly seven times the number per square mile shown for the
much smaller area of 1790, and nearly three times the number shown for
1860. The decrease in the average number of inhabitants per square mile
at the census of 1810 and 1850 was due in each case to large accessions
of thinly populated territory during the decade preceding the census.

In the order of their density of population the nine geographic
divisions of the country rank as follows: Middle Atlantic, 193.2
inhabitants per square mile; New England, 105.7; East North Central,
74.3; East South Central, 46.8; South Atlantic, 45.3; West North
Central, 22.8; West South Central, 20.4; Pacific, 13.2; and Mountain,
3.1. The changes in density from census to census correspond precisely
with the changes in area and the total number of inhabitants. It
may be noted, however, that on account of the rapid increase in
their population the Pacific states in 1910 for the first time are
approaching, in density of population, conditions found in the states
between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.


=Porto Rico.=--Porto Rico contains about 3,600 square miles, and has a
population of considerable more than a million. The climate is tropical
and the land is extremely fertile.


=Postage Stamps.=--They were invented in 1834, and were introduced into
America in 1847.


=Poultry and Egg Industry.=--Nearly 500,000,000 of poultry, including
chickens, turkeys, geese, and pigeons, are raised in the United
States annually. The total value is about $203,000,000. Each year the
production of eggs is about 1,600,000,000 dozen. The people of the
United States eat about 5-1/2 fowls per year per capita, and a little
over 17 dozen eggs.

=Printing Presses.=--There are three distinct classes of printing
presses: (1) The ordinary job press which is used for the printing of
cards, letter-heads, billheads, and other small matter. It is run by
power or by a foot treadle. Each card or piece of paper is fed into
the press by hand and removed by hand. The average speed is from 1,000
to 1,200 an hour, but the most expert feeders can handle about 1,500
cards an hour, and the record is not far from 2,000. (2) The cylinder
press. This press is used for the printing of weekly newspapers, books,
catalogues, and other large work. The type is placed upon a flat bed
having a lateral movement, and the paper is fed by hand onto a cylinder
which revolves over the moving bed. These presses have a speed of
from 1,000 to 2,000 an hour, but comparatively few hand-feeders can
handle more than 1,500, or 1,600 sheets in an hour. (3) The perfecting
press. This press is used exclusively for the printing of large city
newspapers, and some books, and catalogues are printed upon it. The
type matter is cast into to a cylinder. The paper to be printed upon
stereotypes of circular form which are attached is in a continuous
roll and passes between the stereotype cylinder and another roller.
The paper is fed into the press automatically, and is automatically
folded and counted. The largest perfecting press in the world will
print, fold, and count both sides of an eight-page paper at the rate
of 300,000 copies an hour, but the average perfecting press does not
deliver more than 75,000 copies an hour. The perfecting presses used
for books, magazines, and catalogues run at a much slower speed.


=Production of Books.=--In 1911, 8,183 books were produced by American
authors of which 1,024 were fiction; 917 were on theology and
religion; 919 of essays and literature; 527 on hygiene; 734 juvenile;
685 of poetry and drama; 300 educational; 196 were devoted to the fine
arts; and 86 to music.


=Public Debt of the United States.=--The interest-bearing debt of
the United States is $964,631,630, and the non-interest-bearing debt
is $375,974,389. The United States has issued $946,242,270 in gold
certificates, $482,367,666 in silver certificates, and treasury notes
to the amount of $2,846,260. At the last accounting the United States
treasury had on hand in cash $1,564,416,169.


=Public Schools.=--The public school system originated in Massachusetts
and Connecticut shortly after the settlement of those States. Schools
were not entirely free when originally established. They have now
become common all over the United States, and their maintenance is
required by law.


=Pure Food.=--Pure food laws enacted by the United States Government,
and by State and City Governments, are supposed to protect the consumer
against adulterated foods. The United States law, however, has no
jurisdiction over food manufactured or put out in any of the States,
unless it is carried from one State to another. The local food laws
have to do only with the communities covered. The present law does
not appear to be sufficient to protect the public fully. The statement
written on many food packages, reading "Guaranteed Under The Food and
Drugs Act, June 30, 1906. No. ----," must not be considered as proof
positive of purity. It simply means that the contents of the package
or bottle is according to the prescription or formula registered with
the Government, and does not stand for quality or purity. Benzoate
of soda and other preservatives may be legally used, provided a
statement to that effect is made upon the package. Chemists differ as
to the injurious effect of benzoate of soda, but it is not advocated
by any eminent authority. Most of the pure food experts are opposed
to its use, irrespective of any injurious effect it may have upon
the consumer, because this preservative will effectively kill the
odor of putrefaction and disguise the taste and smell of rotten or
spoiled fruit and other products. The consumer will do well to refuse
to purchase any article or food containing benzoate of soda or other
preservative, for first-class and healthy meat, fruit, and vegetables
do not require a chemical preservative. Artificial coloring may not
be injurious, as so little of it is required, but food artificially
preserved may be dangerous, and very likely is impure, and may not have
been fresh when canned.


=Pyramids.=--the pyramids were supposed to have been constructed
between the fifth and twelfth dynasties in Middle Egypt, and not to
have been used for tombs. They are built upon a square base, with
sides facing the points of the compass, and the earlier pyramids were
constructed of horizontal layers of rough blocks fastened together
with mortar. In the center of the pyramid, near the base, was built a
chamber reached by a passage from the north side. It is said that some
of them contain emblems or symbols, which are now used in masonry.
Whether or not there were masons at the time they were built, has not
yet been discovered. Many of the stones weigh as much as thirty tons
each, and no one has yet been able to ascertain the power used for
their transmission.


=Railroads.=--The railroads of the United States employ nearly
1,700,000 men, or about 680 per hundred miles of track. The railroads
occupy over 244,000 miles of track. The most powerful locomotive in
the world runs in Virginia, and weighs 540,000 pounds. The heaviest
electric locomotive is maintained by the Boston & Maine Railroad and
weighs about 192,000 pounds. The most expensive locomotives cost about
$37,000, and an ordinary locomotive costs from $15,000 to $20,000. An
ordinary box car weighs 36,000 pounds, and a day coach about 112,000
pounds. Sleeping cars weigh from 115,000 to 152,000 pounds. The fastest
short-distance run on record was made by the Empire State Express, at
the rate of 112-1/2 miles per hour. A New York train ran a distance
of 44 miles in 33 minutes, or at the rate of 80 miles an hour, and a
New York Central train made the distance between New York and Chicago,
965 miles, in 15 hours and 43 minutes, or at the rate of 62-1/2 miles
per hour. A New York Central train ran a short distance at the rate
of about 112-1/2 miles an hour, and a Florida train ran 5 miles at
the rate of 120 miles an hour. During the last year there were 5,483
accidents by collision and 8,215 by derailments, and a total of 15,743
accidents; 318 passengers were killed, and 16,386 were injured; 3,635
employees were killed, and 142,442 injured; 6,632 persons not connected
with the railroads and not riding on trains were killed, and 10,710
injured. The number of passengers carried during the year was nearly
a billion. The railroads of the United States, not including the
switching and terminal companies, employ nearly 670,000 men, or about
678 men to every 100 miles of track.


=Referendum.=--A law by which all legislation may be referred to the
people, either for its ratification or rejection. The Initiative is a
process by which any law may be enacted, if requested by a specified
number of citizens. The Initiative and Referendum are becoming common,
and their advocates believe that they are the solution to many of our
political problems.


=Religious Denominations.=--In the United States there are 95,800
Adventists, about 5,635,000 Baptists, about 739,000 Congregationalists,
about 1,534,000 Disciples of Christ, about 2,290,000 Lutherans, about
6,280,000 Methodists, about 1,944,000 Presbyterians, about 957,000
Protestant Episcopalians, about 312,000 United Brethren, about 71,000
Unitarians, about 53,000 Universalists, and about 13,000,000 Roman
Catholics.


=Roads.=--The mileage of all public roads in the United States is about
2,200,000 miles, there being a little over 59,000 miles of stone road
and about 103,000 of gravel road. A sand-clay road costs about $725.00
per mile, gravel a little over $2,000.00, macadam about $5,000.00, and
bituminous macadam about $10,350.


=Round Table.=--Tradition says that it was modeled after a table
made by Joseph of Arimathea, and was an imitation of the one used at
the Last Supper. It is said to have had a seating capacity variously
estimated at from thirteen to one hundred and fifty. According to the
legend dealing with King Arthur and his knights, it was a round marble
table made by the Enchanter Merlin for Uther Pendragon. Later it came
into the possession of the King of Camelard, and was given by him to
Arthur on his marriage to the king's daughter Guinevere. The term Round
Table is much used in the United States, and refers to a table, usually
round, occupied habitually by the same diners.


=Royal Academy.=--Founded in London in 1768. It is an association
of artists, and maintains a free school of art. It holds an annual
exhibition of paintings and sculptures.


=Royal Society.=--One of the most celebrated associations in the
world. Organized in London in 1660 for the promotion of scientific
investigation.


=School Statistics.=--There are, in the United States, 36,260 men and
5,025 women acting as professors and instructors in universities,
colleges, and technical schools. The common schools contain nearly
18,000,000 enrolled pupils, with an average daily attendance of nearly
13,000,000. These schools employ nearly 525,000 teachers, who receive
an average monthly salary of about $62.00. The estimated value of
public school property is considerably more than $1,000,000,000, and
the annual cost of maintaining these schools exceeds $426,000,000.


=Seasickness.=--Although there are several advertised remedies which
claim to prevent or to cure seasickness, it is probable that none of
them are efficacious for all persons. Seasickness is not perfectly
understood. Some people suffer from it and some do not. Of course, the
condition of the stomach and liver has much to do with it. If one is
bilious he is pretty sure to become seasick. Before taking a voyage,
it is well to diet or to live on plain food for a while. Do not remain
in your stateroom or in the cabin. Get all of the fresh air you can.
Lie down and don't refuse to eat sparingly. Many persons ward off
seasickness by retiring before the vessel leaves the port. Some people,
even sailors, suffer from seasickness with every voyage. A good remedy
is an emetic, either warm salt water, or warm mustard water.


=Seven Chief Virtues.=--These, as defined by the Roman Catholic Church,
are as follows: (1) Faith, (2) Hope, (3) Charity, (4) Prudence, (5)
Temperance, (6) Justice, (7) Fortitude.


=Seven Corporal Works of Mercy.=--According to the Roman Catholic
Church, these are as follows: (1) To bury the dead, (2) to clothe the
naked, (3) to feed the hungry, (4) to give drink to the thirsty, (5) to
shelter the homeless, (6) to visit those in prison, (7) to administer
unto the sick.


=Seven Deadly Sins.=--According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic
Church, these are as follows: (1) Pride, (2) Anger, (3) Envy, (4)
Sloth, (5) Lust, (6) Covetousness, (7) Gluttony.


=Seven Liberal Arts.=--A term applied during the Middle Ages to the
following branches of learning: (1) Arithmetic, (2) Geometry, (3)
Astronomy, (4) Music, (5) Logic, (6) Rhetoric, (7) Grammar.


=Seven Spiritual Works of Mercy.=--According to the teaching of the
Roman Catholic Church, these are as follows: (1) To admonish the
sinful, (2) to bear wrongs patiently, (3) to comfort the afflicted, (4)
to counsel the doubting, (5) to forgive offenses, (6) to instruct the
ignorant, (7) to pray for the living and the dead.


=Seven Wise Men of Greece.=--Applied to seven Greek sages, whose
wisdom was embodied in the following maxims: (1) Solon of Athens,
"Know thyself"; (2) Chilo of Sparta, "Consider the end"; (3) Thales
of Miletus, "Suretyship brings ruin"; (4) Bias of Priene, "Most men
are bad"; (5) Cleobulus of Lindus, "Avoid extremes"; (6) Pittacus of
Mitylene, "Know thine opportunity"; (7) Periander of Corinth, "Nothing
is impossible to industry."


=Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.=--(1) The Coliseum at Rome, (2) the
Catacombs of Alexandria, (3) the Great Wall of China, (4) the Leaning
Tower of Pisa, (5) the Porcelain Tower of Nanking, (6) the Mosque of
St. Sophia at Constantinople, (7) the Ruins of Stonehenge.


=Seven Wonders of the New World.=--(1) Niagara Falls, (2) Yellowstone
Park, (3) Garden of the Gods, (4) Mammoth Cave, (5) Yosemite Valley,
(6) Giant Trees, (7) Natural Bridge.


=Seven Wonders of the World.=--In ancient times generally regarded as
follows: (1) The Pyramids of Egypt, (2) the Hanging Gardens of Babylon,
(3) the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, (4) the Temple of Diana at Ephesus,
(5) the Colossus of Rhodes, (6) the Pharos at Alexandria, (7) the
Statue of the Olympian Jove in Elis.


=Shaving Lotions.=--Hot water applied to the face after shaving removes
much of the sting or soreness, and the use of bay rum, hamamelis or
witch hazel, or almond cream, is to be recommended. A very good shaving
preparation is made of equal parts of bay rum and hamamelis.

The work on shipboard is done by watches, the crew being mustered into
two divisions, known as the Starboard Watch and Port Watch. The day
begins at noon, and is divided into: Afternoon Watch, noon to 4 P. M.;
First Dog Watch, 4 P. M. to 6 P. M.; Second Dog Watch, 6 P. M. to 8 P.
M.; First Watch, 8 P. M. to Midnight; Middle Watch, 12 A. M. to 4 A.
M.; Morning Watch, 4 A. M. to 8 A. M.; Forenoon Watch, 8 A. M. to noon.


=Slavery.=--Slavery is of a prehistoric origin, but was commercialized
by the Romans, some of whom had as many as 10,000 slaves. In 1834, the
British Colonies emancipated nearly 800,000 slaves, and the Civil War
wiped slavery out of the United States. It does not now exist in any
civilized nation.


=Soap.=--Many of the soaps upon the market are impure and even
dangerous, and never should be used. Most of the standard white soaps,
however, are pure and may be used freely. Cheap laundry soaps are not
only impure, but injure the hands; and many of the highly perfumed
soaps are hardly better than laundry soaps. Thoroughly good soap can
be purchased at retail for not exceeding ten cents a cake, and for this
price one can obtain really all there is in soap. Medicated soaps,
except the antiseptic soaps recommended by physicians, have little
or no value. The reader should purchase only the standard grade of
soaps, and should never pay more than 25 cents a cake for any soap,
because any price in excess of 25 cents is for perfume or represents
exorbitant profit. Every physician is familiar with soap quality, and
will gladly give you a list of reliable soaps without charge. There is
no such thing as a complexion soap, except that all good soaps aid the
complexion. There is no soap safe to use that removes pimples, or keeps
pimples or other skin troubles from coming. Soap has only one value,
and that is, its ability to assist water in cleansing the skin, except
the antiseptic soaps, which may prevent contagion and which should
be used by all who enter the sick-room. Ninety-nine per cent. of the
expensive soaps are no better, save for their perfume, than soap sold
at five or ten cents a cake.


Solar System

The Solar System, of which the earth is a part, consists of eight
planets and the sun, so far as has been discovered. Astronomers have
located 465 asteroids, which are small bodies floating in space and
with apparently established orbits. From time to time, astronomers
claim to have discovered a new planet, but its existence is not as yet
accepted. The following table gives interesting information:

=Spectacles and Glasses.=--If you find it difficult to read, or your
eyes become weak and tired, the chances are you need proper glasses.
Don't attempt to fit them to yourself. Employ a first-class optician or
oculist, the latter if the trouble appears to be serious.

The following records are compiled from the latest and best authorities:

=Airship Records=: Highest altitude reached, 17,881 feet; longest

rules governing baseball were made in New York City, in 1857, and the
National Baseball League was formed in New York City during the same
year. The first champion team was that of New York, in 1858, but it
was not until 1868 that a salaried team was in existence. The National
League was formed in 1876, and the American League in 1881. The largest

Standard Time

Until 1883, each city or district maintained its own time, usually
accepting what is known as True Time. This condition caused
complications. For example: Many railroad-station clocks either gave
two times, or else there were separate clocks for each time, some of
the trains leaving the station on what was know as New York time, while
others left on local time. Banks and business houses closed on either
of the times. There was no standard and no agreement.

In 1883, Standard Time was established.

The First Section was known as the Eastern, and covered all territory
between the Atlantic Coast and a line drawn from Detroit, Michigan, to
Charleston, South Carolina.

The Central Section included everything between the Detroit-Charleston
line, and a line drawn from Bismarck, North Dakota, to the mouth of the
Rio Grande River.

The Third Section, known as "Mountain Time," included the territory
between the Bismarck-Rio Grande line and the western borders of Idaho,
Utah, and Arizona.

The Pacific Time Section embraced everything west of the Mountain Time
line, up to and including the Pacific coast.

There is a difference of just one hour between the sections. When it is
12 o'clock at Boston, Mass., or at New York City, it is 11 o'clock at
Chicago, and at San Francisco 9 o'clock.

The changing from so-called Local or True Time to Standard Time
required clocks at Boston to be set back 16 minutes; New York clocks to
be set back 4 minutes; Detroit clocks to be set back 28 minutes; St.
Louis clocks to be moved ahead one minute; and San Francisco clocks to
be set ahead ten minutes.

Standard Time has been accepted by every State and by practically
every city, although a very few cities and towns unprogressively hold
to the former or True Time. The Canadian Pacific Railroad, which has
the longest mileage of any railroad in the world, is run on what is
known as the 24-Hour Time; that is, the faces of its clocks, instead
of bearing the figures 1 to 12, run from 1 to 24 inclusive. The
time-tables are rather confusing, as trains are billed to arrive and
depart at 13:10, 16:14, 23:30, etc. This system appears to have only
one advantage,--that it eliminates the use of A. M. and P. M. It is
possible that it will be accepted elsewhere, and even generally, but
not for the present.


=Star Chamber.=--A tribunal, made up of a committee of the King's
Privy Council, instituted or revived in 1486. It was supposed to have
almost unlimited powers and to be exempt from any rules or law. It had
the right to inflict any form of punishment except death. The term is
now applied to assemblies or committees or others who conduct their
investigations and decide upon questions in secret.

=Star-Spangled Banner.=--The national song of the United States.
Composed by Francis Scott Key on the night of September 13, 1814. "The
cartel-ship _Minden_ was anchored in sight of Fort McHenry, and from
her deck Key saw, during the night of 13 Sept., 1814, the bombardment
of that fortress. It was during the excitement of this attack, and
while pacing the deck of the _Minden_ with intense anxiety between
midnight and dawn, that Key composed the song. It was first written on
the back of a letter, and after his return to Baltimore copied out in
full."--Harper's "Book of Facts."

Stature and Weights

There have appeared in public print, several tables, which, the
compilers claim, are based upon Greek and other measurements. It is
probable that few of these tables are authentic, and many of them are,
undoubtedly, incorrect. The following table is compiled by Jay W.
Seaver, M. D., for 20 years professor at Yale University, and is as
nearly correct as possibility would admit. Dr. Seaver, however, does
not claim absolute correctness. The second and third tables given are
used quite generally in civil service examinations by local, state, and
national governments, and apply largely to those seeking positions on
the police force or the fire department

=Steam Engine.=--The principle of the steam engine is very simple.
Stripped of all technicality, it may be described as follows: Take a
can with a height somewhat longer than its width, and close up both
ends. Make a hole in the center of one of the ends large enough for the
insertion of a rod about the diameter of a small poker. Fasten one end
of this rod to the center of a disc which will fit closely into the
can. Insert this disc in the can with the poker passing through the
hole. The whole apparatus will be similar to that of a churn. Bore two
holes in the sides of the can, at top and bottom. Allow steam to pass
into the can through the first hole, which will force the disc to the
other end of the can, and draw the poker with it. Then, introduce steam
through the other hole. This will drive the disc to the other end of
the can, and at the same time the steam entering the first hole will
pass out. This gives a motion to the poker rod, which continues so long
as steam is forced in and out. The rod, is, of course, connected with a
crank which works on a shaft, and from this shaft power is transmitted.
The steam is let into the cylinder automatically. A fly wheel is
maintained where there is not more than one cylinder, and even where
there is more than one, so as to create momentum, which carries the
crank beyond its dead center. The modern steam engine makes from 100 to
even 1,000 revolutions a minute. Its power is measured by its capacity
to equal that of one or several horses, and is known as horse-power.
Steam engines are made with a capacity of only a small fraction of
horse-power, and up to several thousand. But usually, where great power
is required, more than one cylinder is used, all of them working upon
the same shaft The so-called turbine steam engine is similar to the
ordinary turbine water wheel, except that steam, instead of water, is
forced against it. See "Turbines."


=Strikes.=--The strike is an agreement upon the part of workmen to
refuse to work until their demands are accepted. The first strike
in the United States took place in New York City, in 1803, and was
confined to sailors. In 1888, there were 697 strikes, involving over
210,000 employees. In 1886, the number of strikes increased 52 per
cent., and in 1888 the increase was 22 per cent. In the early days
nearly half of the strikes were in Pennsylvania. The great coal
strike of 1902 was probably the most disastrous and largest strike on
record. It involved about 150,000 men, with a loss of wages of nearly
$40,000,000.


=Sub Rosa.=--The term "under the rose" implies secrecy. It had its
origin B. C. 477, when Pausanias, commander of the fleet of Spartans
and Athenians, was intriguing with Xerxes for the subjugation of Greece
to Persia and for the hand of the king's daughter in marriage. The
business was transacted in the "Brazen House," the roof of which was a
garden making a bower of roses. Hence the term Sub Rosa.


=Sugar Industry.=--The United States consumes each year nearly
3,500,000 tons of sugar, or about 80 pounds per capita.


=Sunday Schools.=--The Sunday Schools of the United States have a
membership of about 15,500,000, including teachers. The Sunday School
membership of England and Wales is over 7,000,000. Connected with the
Sunday Schools of the world are about 2,650,000 teachers and 26,500,000
scholars.


=Talking Machines.=--The talking machine, known by several names,
including the phonograph, was originally invented by Edison.
Unscientifically speaking, it consists of a disc similar to that used
in the telephone, with a needle or point attached to the center of the
underside of it. This needle or point fits into circular or cylindrical
grooves, which are covered with tin foil or other malleable substance.

The vibrations of the voice or of music, which reach the disc, cause
this needle or point to rise or fall, producing impressions upon the
tin foil or other substance. After the record has been made, duplicates
are produced in a substance largely made of rubber, which is placed on
a rotary disc or cylinder that is turned automatically, the needle or
point attached to the disc working into the grooves and rising with or
following the impressions, which cause the plate or disc to vibrate.
The process is wholly mechanical, and electricity is not used.


=Tariff.=--This word, meaning a schedule of duties on merchandise,
imported or exported, is said to come from Tarifa, a town in Southern
Spain, on the Mediterranean Sea, where duties were once levied by the
Moors on all ships passing in or out of the Straits of Gibraltar.


=Telegraph.=--The conception of the telegraph came to Professor Morse,
in 1832, while he was making a voyage from Europe to America, and he at
once began his experiments, which resulted in what may be considered
one of the two greatest inventions or discoveries. After waiting about
eight years, Congress reluctantly appropriated a sum sufficient to
build a telegraph line between Washington and Baltimore. The original
conception of telegraphy belongs wholly to Professor Morse, but since
its invention other scientists have invented improvements, including an
apparatus which allows the sending of two messages each way, or four
messages in all, over the same wire at the same time. The telegraphic
code or alphabet, originally invented by Morse, remains practically
intact. It consists of dots and dashes, and may be learned in a few
hours, although expertness requires a year or more of practice.
Unscientifically speaking, the telegraphic apparatus is extremely
simple: it consists primarily of a piece of soft iron around which
is wound several strands of insulated wire. During the time that
electricity is passing through this wire, the soft iron becomes a
magnet, but returns to its nonmagnetic character when electricity
is not passing around it. A battery is used for the generating of
electricity. The operator turns electricity into the wire by pressing a
key. When the key is down, the electricity passes around the piece of
soft iron and makes of it a magnet, which will draw iron or steel to
it, the same as does any ordinary permanent magnet. Just above the end
of the soft iron is placed a piece of metal, and as the key is pressed
letting in the electricity, the iron (then a magnet) draws this metal
to it, producing a slight sound or click. This piece of iron is held
by a spring, and springs back into place when electricity is let out
of the insulated wire surrounding the soft iron. If a message is to
be sent a long distance, a relay is used so as to turn into the wire
additional currents of electricity, because electricity loses some of
its strength if carried over a very long wire, and a relay adds new or
fresh currents from separate batteries. In this way, a message can be
sent continuously for several thousand miles, which would be impossible
without the use of relays. The process of sending several messages at
the same time over the same wire is somewhat complicated. The result
is obtained by using currents of electricity of different intensity,
the currents not interfering with each other. The ocean cables are
described under another heading.


=Telephone.=--The telephone is supposed to have been invented by
Professor A. G. Bell, in 1875, but scientists recognize the probable
invention of it, largely in theory, by the eminent scientists Dolbear,
Gray, Edison, and possibly others. It is exceedingly difficult to
describe, other than scientifically, the working of the telephone; and
it cannot be done perfectly until electricity is fully understood. We
know the result, but are not able to locate all of the causes. The
original telephone consisted of a bar of magnetized steel of about the
circumference of an ordinary poker, a few inches in length, around
which was wound insulated wire. At one end of the magnet, and close
to it, was placed a metallic disc about twice the circumference of a
silver dollar and of the thickness of thin tin. Originally the same
instrument was used both for sending and for receiving. Any sound,
including the human voice, brought in direct contact with the disc,
caused it to vibrate, and for some unknown reason these vibrations were
transmitted through the magnet, and by the wires carried to another
similar instrument. The sounds and voice were carried a short distance
without the use of a battery, and the early telephones had ground
circuits; that is, there was only one wire between the stations, the
other wire being grounded by being attached to gas or other pipes,
the electricity making half the circuit through the earth. Later on
a battery was used, which increased the sending distances, but the
ground wire remained for some time. The present telephone consists
of the original telephone as a receiver, but with a transmitter into
which the sender speaks his words. The mechanism of the transmitter
is complicated and cannot be described except scientifically. Its
use allows one to talk long distances, even to the extent of 2,000
miles. Non-technically speaking, then, the telephone consists of a
magnet, insulated wire, and a disc, the vibration upon the disc being
transmitted over the wire from the sending to the receiving station,
electricity being used for conveying the vibrations or sound.

Eight billion, four hundred thousand and twenty-seven million
conversations were held in this country last year over the wires of
the American Telephone and Telegraph Co., according to its annual
report. The daily average was 26,310,000. The company now has telephone
stations in 70,000 cities, towns, and hamlets, which is 5,000 more than
the number of postoffices in the country, and 10,000 more than the
number of railroad stations. Altogether there were 7,456,074 telephone
stations of the company at the end of 1912.


=Ten Great Religions.=--James Freeman Clarke, in his book "Ten Great
Religions," gives the following as the ten most important faiths of
ancient and modern times:

  (1) Confucianism.
  (2) Brahmanism.
  (3) Buddhism.
  (4) Zoroastrianism.
  (5) Religion of Egypt.
  (6) Religion of Greece and Rome.
  (7) Teutonic and Scandinavian Religion.
  (8) Judaism.
  (9) Christianity.
  (10) Islâm.


=Théâtre Français.=--The most famous theatre in Paris, and, perhaps,
in the world. It is situated in the Place du Palais Royal, and is the
home of the Comédie Française. In 1900 it was destroyed by fire, but
immediately rebuilt. The original building was erected in 1782, but was
later much altered.


=Thunder.=--The sound of thunder is produced by the sudden rush of the
air into the vacuum caused by the rapid passage of lightning through
the air.


=Ticket-of-Leave.=--The English Government in 1854 issued a permit
which allowed a convict his liberty before the expiration of his term.
It was necessary for him to report to the police at stated times,
and, if he committed any crime, his ticket-of-leave was recalled. The
ticket-of-leave is similar to probation granted in the United States.


=Time Difference.=--When it is 12 o'clock noon in New York City, it
is 5:13 in Antwerp; about 5:49 in Berlin; about 5:13 in Brussels;
about 1:02 in Buenos Ayres; about 10:49 in Calcutta; about 6:53 in
Constantinople; about 4:30 in Dublin; about 4:34 in Liverpool; about
4:56 in London; about 5:05 in Paris; about 5:46 in Rome; about 6:57
in St. Petersburg. When it is 12 o'clock noon in New York City, it is
33-1/2 minutes earlier in Havana; about 11 hours and 28 minutes earlier
in Hong Kong; about 9 hours and 24 minutes earlier in Melbourne; about
9 hours and 45-1/2 minutes earlier in Yokohama.


=Tobacco Industry.=--The United States grows about 905,000,000 pounds
of tobacco a year, and over a million acres are used for growing
tobacco. The value of the tobacco grown each year is about $85,000,000.


=To Estimate the Weight of Hay.=--Find the length, breadth, and depth
of the hay, in feet, and multiply these three dimensions together; if
the hay is on the wagon or newly stored, divide the product by 540; but
if it is well settled in the mow or stack, divide by 512. If the hay
is baled, 270 cubic feet will weigh a ton. The number of cubic feet in
a circular stack is found by multiplying the average circumference in
yards by itself and this product by four times the height of the stack
in yards; then point off the two right-hand figures and multiply the
result by 27.


=To Find Length of Day or Night.=--At any time of the year add 12
hours to the time of the sun's setting, and from the sum subtract the
time of rising for the length of the day. Subtract the time of setting
from 12 hours, and to the remainder add the time of rising next morning
for the length of the night. These rules are equally true for apparent
time.


=To Measure Corn in the Crib.=--Find the length, breadth, and depth
of the corn, in feet, and multiply these three dimensions together;
this product multiplied by .63 will give the number of heaped bushels
in the ear. Sometimes one and one-half bushels of ears make a bushel
of shelled corn, and sometimes it requires two bushels, the amount
required depending upon the size of the cob, shape of the ear, etc.


=Tom Thumb.=--Tom Thumb was probably the most famous dwarf in the
world, not because of the absence of others of the same height, or
less, but because he was exploited by the late P. T. Barnum. Tom Thumb,
whose real name was Charles S. Stratton, was born in 1838, and died in
1883. In 1842 he was two feet in height and weighed sixteen pounds.
In 1863 his height increased to thirty-one inches, and later to forty
inches.


=To Produce Different Colors.=--The color printed in _italics_ may be
made by mixing the other two colors. _Purple_, red with light blue.
_Brown_, red with black. _Rose_, lake with white. _Drab_, umber with
white. _Chestnut_, white with brown. _Chocolate_, yellow with brown.
_Flesh Color_, carmine with straw. _Pearl_, blue with lead color.
_Pink_, carmine with white. _Silver Gray_, lamp black with indigo.
_Lead Color_, lamp black with white. _Bright Green_, Paris green with
white. _Buff_, yellow ochre with white. _French White_, white tinted
with purple. _Dark Green_, black with chrome green. _Brilliant Green_,
emerald green with white. _Pea Green_, chrome green with white.
_Orange_, vermillion with chrome yellow. _Straw Color_, chrome yellow
with white lead. _Cream Color_, white tinted with red and yellow.
_Ashes of Roses_, white with tints of black and purple. _French Gray_,
white tinted with black and purple. _Olive_, chrome yellow, blue, and
black with red.


=Trade Unions.=--The trade union, although supposed to be of modern
origin, was established as early as 1548. Mythical history which,
of course, cannot be authenticated, indicates the possibility of an
organization of working men at the time of the building of Solomon's
temple. During the last several years, trade unionism has grown to
enormous proportions, and practically every vocation has its union or
organization. The right to organize is self-evident, so long as it does
not restrain trade or interfere with personal rights. The employee
and employer certainly have legal and moral rights to do as they
please, provided they do not interfere with legal or moral law, and
do not use coercion. Moral influence, however, cannot be criticised.
The maintenance of a well-organized labor union is to the advantage
of both capital and labor, and should be encouraged. Naturally, the
binding together of laborers or workmen, and that of capital, causes
some abuses, for humanity, as it runs, is not always fair; but one
should not criticise either side without criticising the other. Both
have their advantages and disadvantages, both are fair and unfair. As
civilization progresses, the mistakes and abuses will be corrected, and
organized labor and capital will work in harmony.


=Trusts.=--A trust is an association of capitalists, organized for
the purpose of controlling any one trade or trades. It is illegal and
may be punished by imprisonment or fine. It is exceedingly difficult,
however, to discover whether or not an organization is in actual
restraint of trade, and to prosecute a combination. Undoubtedly trusts
exist in America, and all over the world for that matter, and are
illegal. Great effort is being made to disband them, but so far has
very little real effect, for most of the trusts which are disorganized
by law continue in some other form.


=Turbines.=--The turbine has largely taken the place of the water
wheel, because it is more compact, produces greater energy, and is more
powerful. It is, untechnically speaking, a box containing a series of
fanlike blades set at an angle, so that water or steam brought against
them will make them turn.


=Type.=--Movable metallic type was invented by Gutenberg, of Germany,
about 1450. Before this time, all books and papers were either
hand-written or printed from engraved wooden blocks. To-day there are
over 50,000 faces and sizes of type. Type is divided into three great
classes: (1) Roman or body type, which is used for the reading matter
in newspapers, magazines, and books; (2) display type, which appears in
headings, and is used for circulars and the like; and (3) ornamental
type, which has a fancy face. The different sizes of type formerly
bore arbitrary names, like Nonpareil, Pica, etc., but now all type is
under the point system, Nonpareil being known as 6 Point and Pica as
12 Point. The reading matter in all large daily newspapers is set in
6 Point, but most books are printed from either 10, 11, or 12 Point.
Twelve Point type has twice the depth of 6 Point type. Type to be set
is placed in two cases, one known as upper case and the other as lower
case, the former holding capitals and small capitals; the latter small
letters and figures, both cases containing boxes for spaces and other
characters. The compositor holds in his left hand what is known as a
composing stick, or stick. It is made of metal, with a bottom and three
sides, the left side being movable and adjustable. The compositor
places one piece of type at a time in the stick, setting the type from
left to right and upside down. He places metal spaces between each
word. When a line is completed, he sets another, with or without a
piece of thin metal between the lines, known as a lead. When the stick
is full, he dumps his type into a galley, which is a receptacle made of
wood or metal, from one to three feet long, framed at the bottom and at
the sides, but open at the other end. The type is then locked up in a
steel frame or chase, and is ready to be stereotyped, electrotyped, or
to be printed from.


=United States Flag.=--On June 14, 1777, the United States Congress
declared "that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars,
white in a blue field, representing the new constellation." In 1794
Congress decreed that after May 1st, 1795, "The flag of the United
States be fifteen stripes, alternate red and white, and that the Union
be fifteen stars, white in a blue field." At that time the stars and
stripes were of equal number, and it was the intention to add both a
star and stripe with the addition of each new State. Subsequently,
it was found that the addition of a stripe for each new State would
produce a flag altogether too large. Accordingly, Congress, on April
4th, 1818, reduced the number of stripes to thirteen and made the
number of stars twenty, that being the number of States at that time.
It was further enacted that a new star should be added as each new
State was admitted into the Union. By act of Congress, the flag has
become a sacred emblem, and cannot be used for other than decorative or
patriotic purposes, and cannot serve as a part of an advertisement or
other announcement.

=University Extension.=--A scheme for extending to people at large the
advantages of a university education, by means of courses of lectures
and classes in various important cities. The scheme originated at the
University of Cambridge, England, in 1872, and was introduced into the
United States in 1890.


=University Settlements.=--Homes established in the poorer parts of
cities, where educated and cultured people may live and try to improve
the lives of their neighbors. Lectures, studies, and various other
devices are resorted to. The movement started in England in 1867, and
appeared in New York in 1887, as a "Neighborhood Guild." University
settlements are now found in all the chief cities of the United States.


=Utopia.=--An imaginary island, with an ideal commonwealth, the
inhabitants of which enjoy perfect laws and institutions. It is
described in Sir Thomas More's political romance, "De Optimo
Reipublicae Statu, deque Nova Insula Utopia," published in Latin in
1516, and translated into English in 1551. His purpose was to describe
his idea of social arrangements by which the people's most absolute
happiness and improvement might be secured.


=Vaccination.=--Vaccination, a preventive of smallpox, was discovered
by Dr. Edward Jenner of England. It consists of injecting into
the blood a virus made from the sores or scabs of cows suffering
from cowpox, or the virus may be taken from the sore coming from
vaccination itself. Comparatively few people, properly vaccinated, can
have the smallpox, and are largely exempt from any disease resembling
it, except that which is known as varioloid, which is a mild form of
smallpox. It is not known how long vaccination remains a preventive,
but probably for seven years, when one should be vaccinated again. The
prejudice against vaccination, which was very intense at its discovery,
no longer exists except among a few. Practically every physician
advocates it, and it is compulsory in some towns and cities. Deaths
have occurred from it, but they are very infrequent.


=Vacuum.=--The perfect vacuum, which it is impossible to produce, is
space without air or atmosphere. Vacuums are made by pumping all the
air out of a receptacle or chamber. In a vacuum, everything falls
at the same rapidity, as there is nothing to buoy it up, a feather
descending as rapidly as lead shot.


=Vedas.=--Sacred writings of the Hindus, hymns, prayers, and liturgies,
said to have been compiled by Vyasa about 1200 B. C. They are written
in Sanskrit, and divided into four parts.


=Voodooism.=--A degraded form of religion prevalent among the negroes
of Hayti and the Southern States of America. Supposed to be a relic of
the religion of equatorial Africa.


=Watered Stock.=--It is said that the late Commodore Vanderbilt
originated what is known as watered stock. Watered stock is
capitalizing an industry at a figure in advance of its real value.
For example: a railroad has tangible assets of $10,000,000, and an
earning capacity sufficient to pay a 6 per cent. dividend on its
capitalization; financial giants manipulate the stock and increase it
to, say, $20,000,000, watering it to the extent of 100 per cent. In
other words, the real value of the stock then is one-half of what it
was in the first place. Stock watering has become epidemic, and is
the cause of hundreds of thousands of financial failures. The stock
waterers, however, as a rule, win, the public being the victims.


=Wealth of the Nations.=--The estimated wealth of the principal
nations of the earth is given in billions: United States, 130; Great
Britain and Ireland, 80; France, 65; Germany, 60-1/2; Russia, 40;
Austria-Hungary, 25; Italy, 20; Belgium, 9; Spain, 5.4; Netherlands, 5;
Portugal, 2.5; Switzerland, 2.4.


Weather Flags

The Weather Bureau maintained by the United States Department of
Agriculture displays at its stations flags which indicate probable
changes in the weather.

A white flag indicates clear or fair weather.

A blue flag, rain or snow.

A flag with the upper half white and the lower half blue, local rain or
snow.

A black triangular flag indicates temperature.

A white flag with black square in center, a cold wave.

When the black triangular flag is placed above the white flag, the
black flag or the white and blue flag, it indicates warmer weather;
when below, colder.

When the black triangular flag is not displayed at all, the temperature
is likely to remain stationary.

Flags are displayed by the Weather Bureau as storm warnings in the
following manner:

Small Craft Warning: A red pennant indicates that moderately strong
winds are expected.

Storm Warning: A red flag with a black center indicates that a storm of
marked violence is expected.

The pennants displayed with the flags indicate the direction of the
wind--white, westerly (from southwest to north); red, easterly (from
northeast to south). The pennant above the flag indicates that the
wind is expected to blow from the northerly quadrants; below, from the
southerly quadrants.

By night a red light indicates easterly winds, and a white light below
a red light, westerly winds.

Hurricane Warning: Two red flags with black centers, displayed
one above the other, indicate the expected approach of a tropical
hurricane, or one of those extremely severe and dangerous storms which
occasionally move across the Lakes and Northern Atlantic coast.

No night small craft or hurricane warnings are displayed.

BOARD AND TIMBER MEASURE

  BOARD MEASURE

 In board measure boards are assumed to be one inch in thickness.

 To compute the measure of surface in square feet--

 When all dimensions are in feet, multiply the length by the breadth,
 and the product will give the surface required.

 When either of the dimensions are in inches, multiply as above and
 divide by 12.

 When all dimensions are in inches, multiply as before and divide
 product by 144.

  TIMBER MEASURE

 To compute the volume of round timber--

 When all dimensions are in feet, multiply the length by the square
 of one-quarter of the main girt, and the product will give the
 measurement in cubic feet.

 When length is given in feet and girt in inches, multiply as before
 and divide by 144.

 When all the dimensions are in inches, multiply as before and divide
 by 1,728.

 Sawed or hewed timber is measured by the cubic foot.

 To compute the volume of square timber--

 When all dimensions are in feet, multiply the product of the breadth
 by the depth by the length, and the product will give the volume in
 cubic feet.

 When either of the dimensions are in inches, multiply as above and
 divide the product by 12.

 When any two of the dimensions are in inches, multiply as before and
 divide the product by 144.


WHAT TO DO IN EMERGENCIES

Many books and pamphlets have been written advising the layman what
to do in a case of emergency, and in the absence of a physician or
surgeon.

Much of the information presented is altogether too technical, and is
not likely to be understood by the public at large.

The author has attempted to cover, in a few pages, the fundamentals
of first aid to the injured, and has carefully avoided technical and
medicinal terms. No amount of information, no matter how carefully
or plainly written, can take the place of the physician or surgeon.
Self-doctoring and -dosing is, or should be, considered a crime, and
no one is justified in attempting to relieve any one suffering from
accident or any other ailment, if it is of possible seriousness, unless
a good physician or surgeon cannot be procured.

First and always, keep your head, and keep cool. Don't get excited.
Work rapidly, but deliberately. If the injury or trouble is at all
serious, summon a surgeon or physician immediately. If you are alone
with the sufferer, it may not be safe for you to leave him, but unless
he is in immediate danger, it is better to call a competent physician,
even though you have to absent yourself from him for a few moments. If
the accident occurs in a crowd, solicit some one who looks trustworthy,
and request him to telephone or otherwise communicate with a doctor.

If you know the cause of the accident or trouble inform the physician
in advance, so that he may be better prepared to meet it and bring with
him instruments and remedies.

The patient or sufferer should be placed in a comfortable position, a
doctor or surgeon summoned, and in the interval the layman may follow
the instructions presented here. If he does so, no harm will be done,
and in many cases suffering will be relieved, and death or serious
illness prevented. But the author again, and most emphatically, urges
the layman to send for a physician or surgeon, and to follow the
instructions or information given in this chapter only as preliminary
to the arrival of the doctor or surgeon, unless the injury be of slight
consequence.

If possible, remove the patient to a quiet place, where there is plenty
of air, and where the temperature is normal.

If there are many people about, request them to keep away.

Place the injured person in a comfortable position, usually upon his
back, and straighten out his legs and arms. If the head is injured,
better lift it above the level of the body; but if it is not, allow the
body to lie on a level.

If the patient is breathing hard, it may be well to lift him into a
sitting position. Loosen his collar, waist-band, and clothing. If he
faints, his head should be slightly lower than his feet. If an arm or
leg is injured, lift it slightly and place it upon a cushion, pillow,
or other support.

If the one injured is unconscious, watch him very carefully. If he is
vomiting, or that tendency is apparent, turn him over on one side so
that the discharge will run out easily and not go into the lungs.

If he is wounded, cut away the clothing covering the wound, but don't
remove any more than is necessary. If he has been burned, pour lukewarm
water, containing a little saleratus or bicarbonate of soda, over
the clothing before you remove it. If he is bleeding severely, stop
the bleeding before dressing the wound. After the wound is dressed
there is nothing for the novice to do, except bring the patient to
consciousness, if unconscious, and remove him to a place of safety and
comfort.

If the accident or injury be serious, or the patient is unconscious,
it is well to request more than one bystander to summon a physician,
because the first one sent may fail, or the physician he telephones to
or calls upon may be unavailable.

Use the telephone, if there is one at hand or nearby, and tell the
physician what you think is the matter with the sufferer or what caused
the accident, that he may be better prepared to bring with him the
instruments necessary.

If you are alone with the patient, and cannot notify a physician or
surgeon without leaving the patient, you must use your best judgment;
but you should make every possible effort to reach a physician at the
earliest possible moment. Remain with the patient long enough to
place him in a comfortable position, and to stop the flow of blood, if
bleeding; then make all haste to notify a physician or surgeon.

The author acknowledges his indebtedness to Johnson's First Aid Manual,
published by Johnson & Johnson of New Brunswick, N. J., and to Jay W.
Seaver, M. D., of New Haven, Conn., and recently of Yale University.


=Accidents.=--Convey the sufferer to a place of safety, and give him
plenty of air. If a shock follows, follow instructions given for shock.
Do not touch the wound with the bare hand. Wear absolutely clean gloves
or wrap the fingers in clean cloth or gauze. Do not attempt to cleanse
the wound. Summon a surgeon immediately.


=Apparent Death.=--Never assume that a person is dead because he
appears to be. Summon a physician. A fairly good test of death is to
hold the hand of the person apparently dead before a candle or other
light, with the fingers stretched out, each touching the other. Gaze
intently between the fingers, and if the person is alive, a red or pink
color will undoubtedly be seen where the fingers touch each other.
Another method is to take a cold piece of polished steel, like a razor
blade or table knife, and hold before the mouth or nose of the person
apparently dead. If moisture does not gather on it, it may be safe to
assume that breathing has stopped; but these tests are not infallible.


=Bandaging.=--There are two kinds of bandages,--the roller bandage
or the triangular or handkerchief bandage. They may be purchased at
any drug store or be made on the spot in an emergency. The purchased
bandages are made of gauze, or muslin, crinolin, elastic webbing,
rubber, or other material. The roller bandages are absorbent, and are
very thin and pliable. They should be placed next to the wound and hold
the fluids. Muslin bandages are stronger than those made of gauze, and
should be used for pressure and outside bandages. Bandages should be
kept in a perfectly clean place, and always covered, either by being
enclosed in a box or wrapped in paper. If an improvised bandage is
used, care should be taken to use a clean cloth. The triangular bandage
is made by cutting a piece of cloth about 36 inches square into two
pieces diagonally. It can be purchased at a drug store, or any clean
cloth can be used if it is of firm texture.


=Baths.=--Cold baths may be taken to reduce fever and in sunstroke
and other cases when the temperature is high. It is well to have the
temperature in the bath at 70° or 80° Fahrenheit, and to reduce the
water until it reaches 60° or 65°. Tepid baths have a temperature of
80° or 90°, and warm baths are of a temperature from 90° to a little
less than 100°. Hot baths may be used in case of shock, apparent
drowning, depression, and similar troubles. The temperature of the
water should vary from 98° to 110°. When the patient leaves the bath,
he should be dried quickly and put to bed. Hot baths may produce
fainting, and should be taken in the presence of an attendant. Do not
guess at the temperature of the water; use a thermometer.


=Bleeding.=--Arterial blood, or blood coming from the arteries, is
bright red, and is discharged in spurts or jets. Such bleeding is
very dangerous, and unless a physician arrives almost immediately the
patient is not likely to survive.

Venous blood, which comes from the veins, is of dark purple color and
flows freely and steadily.

Capillary bleeding comes from injured small veins. It flows slowly,
and such bleeding is dangerous only if it continues. Always summon
a surgeon or physician, and put in a hurry call for him. Force the
patient to lie down in a level position, preferably upon his back.

If the leg or arm is wounded, elevate it. Cut away the clothing
quickly, so that it may be exposed. Press the bleeding places, but
cover your finger with gauze or a clean handkerchief, or compress the
part by using a strong cloth bandage.

If the bleeding comes from an artery, cover your finger with a few
thicknesses of gauze or clean cloth, and press hard upon the wound and
maintain the pressure, which may stop the bleeding. If the wound is
large, crowd a lot of gauze into it, and push it in, then press on the
flesh a little distance above the wound, that is, between the wound and
the heart. This can be done by winding a bandage, a piece of rubber
tubing, string, or rope, or a pair of suspenders may be used, above the
wound.

If the arm or leg is crushed, do not press on the wound, but bring
pressure to bear above it.


=Bleeding from the Veins.=--Lay a piece of gauze over the wound and
bind it on with a firm bandage. Be very careful not to apply your
naked fingers or hand to the wound unless you have washed them in some
antiseptic, but even then it is better to cover your fingers with clean
gauze or cloth. If the bleeding is very severe, apply cracked ice
wrapped in gauze, and hard pressure below the wound. Varicose veins
occasionally bleed. Elevate the arm or leg and bandage it very tightly,
the bandage to be placed directly over the bleeding spot.


=Bleeding from Capillary Veins.=--As the blood oozes, and does not
flow rapidly, expose the wound to the air for a short time, which will
usually check it. The application of hot water is advisable, but warm
water should not be used. Extremely cold water or cracked ice will stop
some bleeding. If copious bleeding occurs around a tooth, it may be
stopped by packing the place with plaster of Paris, or absorbent cotton
may be used. In every case, keep the places warm. After the bleeding is
stopped, give hot drinks, like hot tea, coffee, or milk, if much blood
has been lost.


=Broken Bones.=--Do not attempt to set the break. Handle the patient
carefully. Place him in a comfortable position and undress him,
removing the clothing by cutting it to save time. If it is necessary
to carry him a distance, improvise a splint made of wood or heavy
pasteboard and fasten it around the broken part with bandages. Carry
him to a physician or summon one at once, but let him lie quietly if a
physician can reach him. It is well to have two splints, one on each
side, to be held in place by the same bandages. If the arm is broken,
bandage it and place it in a sling. In every case, summon a physician
or carry the patient to one.


=Chilblains.=--Keep the feet warm and dry. Don't warm them at a fire or
place them in hot water, but bathe them in cold water and rub with a
dry towel. Apply turpentine, camphorated spirits, or oil of wintergreen.


Cleanliness

It is said that cleanliness is next to godliness. Good health is
dependent upon the care of the body, and the body will not remain in a
healthful state unless frequently bathed.

The fact that thousands of persons enjoy good health without even
taking an infrequent bath, must not be used as an argument against
regular bathing. These persons, if in health, live out of doors, and
Nature seems to take care of them; but it is obvious that they would
be healthier and stronger if they gave proper attention to bodily
cleanliness.

The majority of city dwellers, and a large proportion of those living
in the country, work indoors, and their health is dependent upon their
personal cleanliness.

Opinions differ, and some hygienists do not consider the daily bath
essential, but the majority of those who have studied the subject
maintain that perfect health requires the daily bathing of the entire
body.

Without the daily bath one does not begin his work refreshed or with
exhilaration.

A scrub is not to be recommended more than once a week, but a bath
should be taken daily, and the entire body rubbed with a dry towel,
a bath towel to be preferred. Emersion in a tub of water is not
necessary, although it is the best and easiest way of taking a bath,
next to a shower bath. A sponge bath answers all purposes.

A cold plunge should not be taken without the advice of a physician.
The shower bath is very refreshing. A hot bath is seldom advisable. It
is better to have the water of a temperature not much higher than that
of summer heat. A pure soap should be used, and care should be taken
to rinse it from the body. The daily bath is the best preventive of
colds. Comparatively few people who bathe daily suffer from more than
transient colds.

The bath should not be taken in a draught. If the room is cold, work
rapidly and use additional time for rubbing, continuing it until the
skin glows.

The practice of partial bathing is not to be recommended. When you take
a bath, take it all over.

If away from home, and sleeping in a hotel bed, which may have been
occupied by a diseased person, it is well to go over the body carefully
in the morning with an antiseptic soap. Every hotel, and all public
conveyances, are laden with germs, and a bath will prevent many
diseases.

A few drops of ammonia or a teaspoonful of borax placed in the water
in which you bathe will remove the odor of perspiration, but ammonia
should not take the place of good soap.


=Clothing Afire.=--Force the person afire to lie down and roll him over
and over. Wrap him in a rug or blanket, or anything else at hand. Throw
water upon him, but do not wait for water. Wrapping him in a blanket
is sure to extinguish the flames. Under no circumstances allow the
person afire to run about or out of doors.


=Colds.=--Use simple remedies, such as hot lemonade, but if the cold
does not soon abate, consult a physician.


=Diphtheria.=--Consult your physician. Never go near a case of
diphtheria or allow a dog, cat, or other animal to enter the sick-room.
Be careful of every utensil, and do not allow any one else to use them
until they have been washed in antiseptics. Never handle any clothing
or other articles in a sick-room.


Disinfectants

The reader is warned against placing reliance upon any disinfectant,
because it smells of carbolic acid, or has any other strong odor. Many
of the advertised disinfectants are worthless, and some of them are
merely deodorizers, which destroy smell and don't disinfect.

Sulphur or brimstone is probably the best fumigator. Sulphite of iron
(copperas) is cheap and should be used for sewers and drains. Dissolve
a pound and a half in a gallon of water. Two parts of sulphate of zinc
to one part of common salt, dissolved in a gallon of water, is a good
disinfectant for clothing, bed linen, etc.

Carbolic acid is an excellent disinfectant, but is efficacious only
when used at considerable strength, 3 to 5 per cent. Its strong odor
suggests qualities which do not exist, if it is much diluted.

There are many disinfectants upon the market, many of them being
advertised to be efficacious. Some of them are thoroughly reliable, but
others are almost worthless. I would advise the reader not to purchase
or use a disinfectant which is not recommended by a reliable physician.


=Disinfecting Cellars, Yards, Cesspools, etc.=--Use a solution made of
60 pounds of copperas dissolved in a barrel of water. Sprinkle freely
over cellar and put a pailful in a cesspool.


=Disinfecting the Sick-Room.=--Plenty of fresh air and cleanliness are
to be first considered. The clothing, bed linen, and towels should be
washed in a tub containing a zinc chloride solution, and the water
should be boiling hot. A solution of copperas and water should be
immediately placed in all vessels containing discharges.


=Dislocations.=--The novice should never attempt to treat a
dislocation. All he can do is to place the patient in a comfortable
position, using a sling or cushion to support the part injured. A
physician should be summoned.


=Dog Bites.=--Wash the wound with antiseptic soap or pure soap and
water, with borax dissolved in it to the strength of a teaspoonful to
a pint. Hydrophobia occurs very infrequently, and many dogs, supposed
to be mad, are suffering from some other ailment; but a surgeon should
be summoned in all cases whenever it is possible to do so. The bite
of a rat, cat, or other animal is not generally dangerous, but the
wound should be washed with borax and water, as above. Better summon a
surgeon. Suck the wound vigorously before applying washes. There is no
danger to the person sucking a wound of this nature, unless the skin on
his lips or in his mouth is cracked or bleeding, but he may wash his
mouth with borax water if he feels uneasy about it.


Drowning

If the person is conscious tell him that you will save him, which will
prevent him from losing his nerve. If you swim out for him, and he is
struggling, seize him by the hair and turn him over on his back. Swim
on your side, towing him along as you would a log of wood. You may
hold his head with one arm, but do not attempt to support his entire
body. If he struggles violently, hold his head under water until he is
unconscious, so that you can better handle him. Loosen his clothing,
drain water out of lungs by inverting body, clean out his mouth, and
pull his tongue forward. Immediately begin artificial respiration, each
movement to last from four to five seconds. Apply warmth and rubbing,
and when he is conscious give him hot water, coffee, or lemonade.
Artificial breathing is of greatest consequence. Do not give up. Many
persons have been resuscitated after many hours of incessant labor.
Artificial respiration may be performed in the following way:

First--Immediately loosen the clothing about the neck and chest,
exposing them to the wind, except in very severe weather. Get the water
out of the body, first by tickling throat with a feather, or applying
ammonia to the nose; give a severe slap with the open hand upon the
chest and soles of feet; if no immediate result, proceed as follows:

Second--Lay the body down in the open air with the head hanging down
and with its weight on the stomach across any convenient object, such
as a keg, box, boat timber, or your knees. Open the mouth quickly,
drawing the tongue forward with handkerchief or cloth to let the water
escape. Keep the mouth clear of liquid. To relieve the pressure on the
stomach, roll the body gently from side to side and then back on the
stomach. Do this several times to force the water from the stomach and
throat.

Third--Lay the body on the back, make a roll of a coat or any garment,
place it under the shoulders of the patient, allowing the head to fall
back. Then kneel at the head of the patient.

Open patient's mouth and place some small object between teeth.

With tongue pliers or fingers covered with gauze or cloth, grasp his
tongue and draw it out. Tie it down to his chin with cloth or rubber
band.

Grasp the patient's arms at the middle of the forearms, fold them
across his stomach, and raise them over his head to a perpendicular
position, drawing them backward, straight, then forward overhead to
the sides again, pressing the arms on the lower part of the ribs and
side, so as to produce a bellows movement upon the lungs. Do this about
fifteen times a minute.

Apply smelling salts, camphor, or ammonia to the nostrils to excite
breathing.

Fourth--On signs of life, or when breathing is restored, remove the
clothing, dry the body, wrap the patient in warm blankets or hot
cloths. To encourage circulation briskly rub his limbs under the
blankets toward the heart; brandy or aromatic spirits of ammonia may be
given in small doses, with care to avoid strangulation.


Another Method

Another simple method of restoring breathing, one that is being
rapidly adopted, is that known as the Schafer, or prone, method. It has
the great advantage that it can be performed by one man alone. This
method has just been endorsed as the preferable one by a commission
representing the American Medical Association, the National Electric
Light Association, and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

First--Lay patient on stomach with his head to side and withdraw his
tongue, which itself then will hang out if teeth are held apart with
small object. The operator then kneels astride the patient's thighs and
with his hands across the lower ribs swings his body back and forth
rhythmically, pausing about two seconds as his weight falls upon and is
removed from patient. This movement is to be continued at the rate of
about fifteen times a minute.


=To Prevent Drowning.=--The human body weighs, in the water, about one
pound; that is, it is approximately one pound heavier than the water
which it displaces. A stool, chair, or small box or board will overcome
the tendency to sink and will keep the head above water. The feet, and
the hand which is not clinging to an object, should be used as paddles.
Every one should learn to swim. If he can take only a few strokes, the
chances of death by drowning are small, for he is likely to be able to
reach something which will support him. So much do I believe in the
necessity of knowing how to swim, that I consider it a crime not to
understand this art.


=Electrical Accidents.=--Immediately shut off the current, but do not
handle the wire with your naked hands. If rubber gloves are not handy,
cut the wire with an ax or knife, with a piece of woolen cloth wrapped
around the handle. If you pull the sufferer away from the wire, do
not touch him with your bare hands, but cover them with woolen cloth,
or wear rubber or woolen gloves, or remove him by the use of a rope.
The ordinary electric shock will not cause death unless the patient
continues to receive it. Summon a doctor at once. Place the patient in
the open air, with something under his shoulders. Loosen his clothing,
open his mouth, and pull out the tongue. Clear the mouth from saliva.
Force air into his lungs by pressing the base of the ribs about once in
four seconds, then attempt to resuscitate him as you would a drowning
person.


=Emergencies with Children.=--If the child suddenly suffers from
vomiting, purging, and prostration, send for a doctor at once. In the
meantime place him in a hot bath and then carefully dry him with a
warm towel and wrap in warm blankets. If the hands and feet are cold,
apply hot water bottles to the feet and hands. A poultice made of
flaxseed meal (3/4) and mustard (1/4) should be placed over the body.
Five drops of brandy in a teaspoonful of water may be given every 15
minutes. For sudden diarrhoea, administer one teaspoonful of castor oil
or of spiced syrup of rhubarb. Allow the child to drink freely of cold
water that has been boiled. Always summon a physician.


Emergency Medicines ..

The writer would emphatically discourage self-medication and dosing,
and would oppose the taking of medicines of any kind, except the
simplest remedies, without the advice of a physician. Hundreds of
thousands of people have been made sick, because the wrong medicine
was administered to them, and many more have taken medicine when they
didn't need it.

The following emergency medicines are presented, with a distinct
understanding that they should not be used except in simple cases:


=Ammonia.=--What is known as ammonia water, or liquor of ammonia,
or as spirits of hartshorn, or hartshorn, is of several strengths
and is highly irritating and poisonous if taken internally. Applied
externally, if of considerable strength, it will cause blisters and
pain. Ammonia should not be applied to an open wound or irritated
surface, except in case of snake bites or stings of insects, where it
is intended to neutralize the poisons. The vapor of ammonia water,
inhaled through the nostrils, affects the nervous system and may be
used in fainting or epilepsy, but always with caution, for a strong
preparation of ammonia applied to the nose may produce a violent shock.
It is better to saturate a handkerchief or wad of cotton and hold it a
short distance from the nostrils. The buyer is cautioned against the
use of the strongest ammonia water.


=Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia.=--This is a stimulant, and may be used in
cases of sick headache, hysteria, cholic, or fainting, in doses of from
10 to 30 drops in sweetened water.


=Arnica.=--Tincture of arnica is supposed to be of value in accidents,
and especially efficacious for sprains and bruises. It has some value,
mainly from the alcohol it contains and partly because it is applied
with friction. It is a poison, and never should be taken internally.
For external use it should not be applied at full strength, as it is
apt to cause inflammation if the skin is tender.


=Bicarbonate of Soda.=--Bicarbonate of soda, commonly known as baking
soda or saleratus, is distinct from sal soda or washing soda. It is of
great value in the treatment of burns, and may be used as an antidote
in poisoning by acids.


=Camphor.=--Camphor is purchased in gum or in liquid form. It never
should be taken internally, except by advice of a physician. Nor
should it be applied in its full strength directly to the wounds or to
irritated or inflamed surfaces.


=Ginger.=--The essence or extract of ginger is a very popular remedy
for trouble with the digestive organs, bowel complaints, etc., and
should be taken in doses of from 10 to 40 drops in sweetened water,
milk, or other liquid. It never should be used habitually, because
it may establish a drug habit; nor should large doses be taken to
check diarrhoea, as it is often inadvisable to too rapidly check the
discharges.


=Glycerin.=--Glycerin may be used for burns, and, mixed with equal
parts of rose water, it is a good lotion for chapped hands or lips, but
it is irritating to the skin of some people.


=Peppermint.=--The essence of peppermint may be used for stomach-ache
and bowel complaints, the usual dose being from 10 to 20 drops on sugar
or in sweetened water. Oil of peppermint should not be taken, except
when prescribed by a physician.


=Turpentine.=--Turpentine is the base of most liniments, and it has
some value, but mustard plasters are safer. Turpentine is inflammable,
and never should be applied near an open fire. Turpentine should not be
given internally, unless prescribed by a physician.


=Whisky.=--Whisky, brandy, wine, and all other spirits should be used
sparingly. They are likely to do more harm than good. Hot water, hot
coffee, hot tea, or aromatic spirits of ammonia are to be preferred.
Children should never be given spirituous liquids, except in extreme
cases, and then only 10 to 20 drops in water.


=Witch Hazel or Hamamelis.=--Used as a remedy for sprains, wounds, and
swelling. It is a mild application for chapped hands, and used by the
laity for burns, scalds, cuts, etc. It is not irritating, and is a good
substitute for arnica. Its use externally is absolutely safe.


=Vaseline.=--It is to be recommended for burns, scalds, etc. It is
nonirritating and is not poisonous. It can be used frequently.


=Cold Cream.=--A perfectly safe article to be used for chapped hands
and lips, and skin roughness.


=Emetics and Stimulants.=--In practically all cases, and where poison
has entered the stomach, it is well to empty the stomach immediately.
If a stomach pump cannot be procured, an emetic should be administered.
Doctors would administer ipecac, apomorphine, sulphate of zinc, tartar
emetic, and other drugs, but none of them are likely to be available
before the physician arrives. When notifying the physician tell him,
if possible, the kind of poison taken, so he may be prepared. A
dessert-spoonful of ground dry mustard in a glass of warm water is
likely to produce vomiting. Follow the first dose with a second one.
Then push the forefinger down the throat as far as possible, that the
patient may vomit. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in water and give to
the patient, or administer a teaspoonful of ipecac every few minutes to
a child, and a tablespoonful to an adult. Follow the dose with a glass
of water and then insert the forefinger in the throat. One who has
taken opium does not vomit easily and strenuous efforts should be made
to produce vomiting. If one emetic does not work, give another, and
keep on repeating it.


Exercise

Physical exercises are absolutely essential to health. The working man,
however, is likely to obtain enough of it from his daily action, but
those of sedentary habits, especially those who work indoors, will not
receive sufficient exercise from their labor.

While the gymnasium is to be recommended, and while it has done much to
make weak people strong, I would not advise any one to take more than
very simple gymnasium exercises without the advice of a physician.
Exercises may be taken in the bedroom, with the use of light dumb
bells, or without the use of any apparatus at all.

Walking is the best of all, for it can be enjoyed by those in poor
health or physically weak. It takes one out of doors, and exercise
out of doors is far better than that taken
