a fur string or band of emu feathers was used
by some tribes, but only on great festivities; and the women wore
in the dance a covering of leaves or feathers, which, as among the
Australians on similar occasions, was removed directly afterwards.
Tasmanian dances were performed “with the avowed intention of exciting
the passions of the men, in whose presence one young woman had the
dance to herself.”[1199] Among the Australian Pegulloburras, who
generally go entirely naked, the women on festive occasions wear round
the middle small fringes.[1200] Speaking of the Brazilian Uaupés, Mr.
Wallace asserts that, “while dancing in their festivals, the women
wear a small ‘tanga,’ or apron, made of beads, prettily arranged. It
is only about six inches square, but is never worn at any other time,
and immediately the dance is over, it is taken off.” Besides, their
bodies are painted.[1201] The same was the case with the Tahitian
Areois—a sort of privileged libertines, leading a most licentious
life, and practising lewd dances and pantomimes,—who also sometimes,
on public occasions, put on a girdle of the yellow “ti” leaves,
which, in appearance, resembled the feather girdles of the Peruvians
or other South American tribes.[1202] As to the South African Basutos,
Mr. Casalis states that marriageable girls “frequently indulge in
grotesque dances, and at those times wear, as a sort of petticoat,
long bands composed of a series of rushes artistically strung
together.”[1203]

Very generally in the savage world, where climate does not put
obstacles in the way, both sexes go naked till they reach manhood,
covering being resorted to at the same period of life as other
ornaments.[1204] A South Australian boy, for instance, when fourteen
or sixteen years old, has to undergo the initiatory rites of manhood
as follows:—he is smeared all over with red ochre and grease, the hair
is plucked from his body, and all his friends gather green gum bushes,
which they place under his armpits and over the _os pubis_, after which
the boy is entitled to marry.[1205]

In conformity with other ornaments, what we consider decent covering
is said to be more common with savage men than with women. “If dress
were the result of a feeling of shame,” Professor Waitz observes, “we
should expect it to be more indispensable to woman than to man, which
is not the case.”[1206] In America, according to v. Humboldt—among the
Caribs, for instance—the men are often more decently clothed than the
women.[1207] The same is stated of the Nagas of Upper Assam;[1208] and
Barth, who had a vast experience of African savages, remarks, “I have
observed that many heathen tribes consider a covering, however poor and
scanty it may be, more necessary for man than woman.”[1209] Whether
this is the rule among savage peoples is doubtful. At any rate, the
egoism of the men cannot be blamed for the nakedness of the women. For
a savage Eve may pluck her clothes from the trees.

In support of the psychological presumption which underlies the
hypothesis here adduced, it may be added that some peoples are in the
habit of covering other parts of the body also, in order to “excite
through the unknown.” Thus, among the Tipperahs, the married women
wear nothing but a short petticoat, while the unmarried girls cover
the breast with a gaily-dyed cloth with fringed ends.[1210] Among the
Toungtha, the bosoms of women are left uncovered after the birth of the
first child, but the unmarried girls wear a narrow breast cloth.[1211]
The Chinese consider small feet to be the chief charm of their women,
and the girls have to undergo horrible torture while their feet are
being compressed to the smallest possible size. It might be supposed
that they would at least have the pleasure of fascinating the men by
a beauty so painfully acquired. But Dr. Stricker assures us that, in
China, a woman is considered immodest if she shows her artificially
distorted foot to a man. It is even improper to speak of a woman’s
foot, and in decent pictures this part is always concealed under the
dress.[1212] The women of Agades, according to Barth, generally go
unveiled, and if they sometimes cover their heads, this is done rather
from coquetry than from a feeling of shame.[1213] Mr. Man remarks
that a Hindu woman who attempts to hide her face, while she wears a
gauze which displays her whole form, in her simulated modesty always
appears as if attempting to convey an _arrière pensée_.[1214] Among
the Tacullies, it is customary for the girls to have over their eyes
a kind of veil or fringe, made either of strung beads or of narrow
strips of deer skin garnished with porcupine quills;[1215] and, among
the Chawanons, according to Moore, those young women who have any
pretensions to beauty, as soon as they become marriageable, “muffle
themselves up so that when they go abroad it is impossible to see
anything but their eyes. On these indications of beauty they are
eagerly sought in marriage.”[1216]

Finally, it is worth noting that this covering, or half covering, is
only one of the means by which savage men and women endeavor to direct
attention to that which civilized man conceals from a sense of shame.
Among the Admiralty Islanders, the only covering is a shell, which
shell is often tastefully engraved with the usual zigzag patterns,
whilst its dazzling whiteness forms a very striking contrast with the
blackness of the skin.[1217] On reaching puberty, the Tankhul Nagas
assume, instead of a shell, a horn or ivory ring from an eighth to
a quarter of an inch in breadth; being apparently of opinion that
exposure, if so attended, is not a matter to be ashamed of.[1218] Some
of the Brazilian Tupis, according to Castlenau, “mentulam inserunt in
annulum ligneum, unde appellantur Porrudos, _i.e._ mentulati;”[1219]
and, in several of the South Sea Islands, those parts of the body
which civilized people are most anxious to conceal, are decorated with
tattoos.[1220] De indigenis Tanembaris et Timorlaonis dum loquitur
Reidel, adulescentes et puellas dicit saepe consulto abradere pilos
pubis nulla alia mente, nisi ut illæ partes alteri sexui magis
conspicuæ fiant.[1221]

Above all the practice of circumcision should be noticed in this
connection, since, as I believe, it owes its origin to the same
cause. It is by no means a specifically Jewish custom, but is widely
spread over the earth. It is in use among all the Mohammedan peoples,
among most of the tribes inhabiting the African West Coast, among the
Kafirs, among nearly all the peoples of Eastern Africa, among the
Christian Abyssinians, Bogos, and Copts,[1222] throughout all the
various tribes inhabiting Madagascar,[1223] and, in the heart of the
Black Continent, among the Monbuttu and Akka. Moreover, it is practised
very commonly in Australia, in many islands of Melanesia,[1224] and
in Polynesia universally. It has also been met with in some parts of
America: in Yucatan,[1225] on the Orinoco,[1226] and among certain
tribes in the Rio Branco in Brazil.[1227] The Jews, Mohammedans,[1228]
Abyssinians,[1229] and some other peoples being excepted, it is always
performed when the boy attains manhood—_i.e._, at the same age as
that at which he is tattooed or painted, or begins to dress or adorn
himself. Indeed, through the operation of circumcision, the boy becomes
a man, and, where it is wanting, some other operation or deformation
of the body supplies its place.[1230] Thus, in Australia, some tribes
practise circumcision, others knock out teeth, when the youth becomes
virile.[1231] Where circumcision is in use it is generally considered
an indispensable preliminary to marriage, “uncircumcised” being a
bad word, and the women often refusing all intercourse with such a
man.[1232]

Several different explanations of this custom have been
suggested.[1233] Some authors believe that it is due to hygienic
motives. But circumcised and uncircumcised peoples live under the
same conditions in the same neighbourhood side by side, without any
difference in their physical condition.[1234] Mr. Sturt remarks that,
in Australia, “you would meet with a tribe with which that custom did
not prevail, between two with which it did.”[1235] Moreover, as Mr.
Spencer observes, while the usage does not exist among the most cleanly
races in the world, it is common among the most uncleanly.[1236] Among
the Damaras and Bechuanas, the boys are circumcised, though these
peoples are described as exceedingly filthy in their habits,[1237] and
so also among the people of Madagascar and the Malays, who are far from
being so cleanly as might be desired.[1238]

Again, according to Mr. Spencer, circumcision involves an offering to
the gods. He suggests that in the first instance vanquished enemies
were mutilated in order that a specially valuable trophy after a battle
might be presented to the king Then, “in a highly militant society
governed by a divinely-descended despot, ... we may expect that the
presentation to the king of these trophies taken from enslaved enemies,
will develop into the offering to the god of like trophies taken from
each generation of male citizens in acknowledgment of their slavery
to him.”[1239] This conclusion Mr. Spencer draws from the single fact
that, “among the Abyssinians, the trophy taken by circumcision from
an enemy’s dead body is presented by each warrior to his chief.” But
there is no evidence whatever that this curious custom is of common
occurrence. Circumcision is spread over a very large part of the
earth, and prevails even in societies which are not “governed by a
divinely-descended despot,” who could require all his subjects to bear
this badge of servitude. With regard to the Australian aborigines, many
tribes of whom practise circumcision, Mr. Curr says, “On the subject
of government (by which I mean the habitual exercise of authority, by
one or a few individuals, over a community or a body of persons) I have
made many inquiries and received written replies from the observers
of about a hundred tribes to the effect that none exists. Indeed, no
fact connected with our tribes seems better established.”[1240] Since
there is nothing to indicate that there ever was a different state
of things in Australia, how are we to reconcile these facts with the
interpretation offered by Mr. Spencer?

In the Book of Genesis the practice of circumcision is presented as
a religious rite, deriving its origin from a command of God. But
among most peoples it appears to have little, if any, religious
significance.[1241] Sometimes, indeed, it is performed by a priest
of the community, but, as Herr Andree justly remarks, this has no
necessary relation to the question, the priests generally being the
physicians of savage tribes.[1242] Moreover, as has already been
pointed out, almost every ancestral custom may by degrees take a
religious character. Thus, the ancient Peruvians’ habit of enlarging
the lobe of the ear, so as to enable it to carry ear-tubes of great
size, is supposed to have been connected with sun-worship; for Spanish
historians mention that elaborate religious ceremonies were held at
the Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, on the occasion of the boring of the
ears of young Peruvian nobles.[1243] But we should not be warranted in
inferring that this custom had originally anything to do with religion.
With regard to circumcision among the Jews, I agree with Herr Andree
that its religious character was almost certainly of a comparatively
late date.[1244]

The peoples among whom this practice prevails are themselves unable
to give any adequate account of its origin. With reference to the
circumcision of the Southern Africans, the Rev. H. H. Dugmore says
that they do not know how it began and that they have no traditionary
remembrances about it, except that it has prevailed as a national
custom from generation to generation. “Our forefathers did so, and
therefore we do the same,” is all that the present generation can say
about the matter.[1245]

That the practice of circumcision arose from the same desire as that
which led to other kinds of mutilation, is rendered more probable
by the fact that disfiguration is sometimes effected in quite a
different way. Novae Zealandiae incolas Cook narrat non solum se
non circumcidere, sed contra tam necessarium habere praeputium,
ut anteriorem eius partem redimire soleant ligamento, quo glandem
penis tegant.[1246] The same curious usage is met with in some other
Islands of the South Sea;[1247] and in Brazil, according to Dr. Karl
von den Steinen, among the Trumaí.[1248] Indigenae Portus Lincoln
pueros pubertatem ingressos mirum in modum secant: quarzi fragmento
penem ex ore secundum inferiorem partem usque ad scrotum incidunt
itaque totum longitudinis spatium detegunt.[1249] In defence of this
practice, says Mr. Schürmann, the natives had nothing to suggest
except that “it was observed by their forefathers, and must therefore
be upheld by themselves.”[1250] In Ponapé, boys are always subjected
to semi-castration, as Dr. Finsch remarks, in order to prevent the
possibility of orchitis, and, further, because the girls consider men
thus disfigured handsomer and more attractive than others. According to
Captain Wright, the same custom prevails in Niutabutabu, of the Tonga
Islands.[1251]

Among many peoples of Africa, and in certain tribes of the Malay
Archipelago and South America, the girls also undergo a sort of
circumcision, and this is looked upon as an indispensable preliminary
to marriage.[1252] Sunt autem gentes, quarum contrarius mos est,
ut clitoris et labia minora non exsecentur, verum extendantur, et
saepe longissime extendandur. Atque ista etiam deformatio insigne
pulchritudinis existimatur.[1253] De indigenis Ponapéis haec adnotat
Dr. Finsch; labia interna longius extenta et pendentia puellis et
uxoribus singulare sunt incitamentum, quae res eodem modo se habet apud
alias gentes, ut apud Hottentottas.[1254]

It certainly seems strange that such deformities should have been
originally intended to improve the appearance. But we must remember
the rough taste of savages, and the wish for variety so deeply rooted
in human nature. These practices evidently began at a time when man
went in a state of perfect nudity. The mutilations, as the eyes became
accustomed to them, gradually ceased to be interesting, and continued
to be inflicted merely through the force of habit, or from a religious
motive. A new stimulus was then invented, parts of the body which had
formerly been exposed being hidden by a scanty covering: as the Chinese
women at first had their feet pressed in order to excite admiration,
but afterwards began to conceal them from coquetry, or as the Tassai
beauties, though entirely naked otherwise, wear two or three petticoats
one over another.[1255]

       *       *       *       *       *

How, then, are we to explain the connection which undoubtedly exists
between nakedness and the feeling of shame? The hypothesis here set
forth cannot be regarded as fully established until this question is
answered.

“The ideas of modesty,” Forster truly says, “are different in every
country, and change in different periods of time.”[1256] As v. Humboldt
remarks, “A woman in some parts of Asia is not permitted to show
the ends of her fingers; while an Indian of the Caribbean race is far
from considering herself naked, when she wears a ‘guajuco’ two inches
broad. Even this band is regarded as a less essential part of dress
than the pigment which covers the skin. To go out of the hut without
being painted with arnotta, is to transgress all the rules of Caribbean
decency.”[1257] In Tahiti, a person not properly tattooed would “be
as much reproached and shunned, as if with us he should go about the
streets naked;”[1258] and, in Tonga also, the men would think it very
indecent not to be tattooed.[1259]

M. Letourneau reports that, at Basra on the Euphrates, it was the duty
of a woman, if surprised when taking her bath, to turn her face; no
further concealment was considered necessary.[1260] The same habit
prevailed among the fellah women in Egypt;[1261] while, in Arabia,
according to Ebers, a woman acts even more indecorously in uncovering
the back of the head than in uncovering the face, though this also is
carefully hidden.[1262]

The Tubori women in Central Africa wear only a narrow strap, to which
is attached a twig hanging down behind; but they feel greatly ashamed
if the twig happens to fall off.[1263] A Chinese woman, as previously
stated, is not permitted by the law of modesty to show her feet; and
the Samoans considered it most disgraceful to expose the navel.[1264]
The savage tribes of Sumatra and Celebes have a like feeling about the
exposure of the knee, which is always carefully covered.[1265] Speaking
of the horrible mouth adornment worn by the women of Port des Français
(Alaska), which makes the lower part of the mouth jut out two or three
inches, La Pérouse remarks, “We sometimes prevailed on them to pull
off this ornament, to which they with difficulty agreed; they then
testified the same embarrassment, and made the same gestures, as a
woman in Europe who discovers her bosom.”[1266] Et Polynesios, quamquam
eum tenent morem, nullam ut aliam corporis partem nisi glandem penis
tegant, hanc tamen nudare vehementer pudet. Ita Lisiansky animadvertit
indigenas Nukahivae, qui praeputium peni abductum habent et extremam
eius partem lino constrictam, linum illud magni aestimare manifesto
apparere. “Accidit enim,” inquit, “ut frater regis, ubi navem meam
ascendit, linum amitteret, qua occasione mala quam maxime angebatur.
Qui cum constratum navis ingrederetur, illa re commotus partem non
redimitam manibus velavit.”[1267] Dr. Mosely asserts that the Admiralty
Islanders, who wear nothing but a shell, always cover themselves
hastily on removing the shell for barter, and evidently consider that
they are exposing themselves either indecently or irreligiously, if
they show themselves perfectly nude.[1268] The Kubus of Sumatra have a
tradition that they are descendants of the youngest of three brothers,
the first and second of whom were circumcised in the usual way, while
it was found that no instruments would circumcise the third. This so
_ashamed_ him that he betook himself to the woods.[1269]

Ideas of modesty, therefore, are altogether relative and conventional.
Peoples who are accustomed to tattoo themselves are ashamed to appear
untattooed; peoples whose women are in the habit of covering their
faces consider such a covering indispensable for every respectable
woman; peoples who for one reason or another have come to conceal the
navel, the knee, the bosom, or other parts, blush to reveal what is
hidden. It is not the feeling of shame that has provoked the covering,
but the covering that has provoked the feeling of shame.

This feeling, Dr. Bain remarks, “is resolved by a reference to the
dread of being condemned, or ill-thought of, by others.”[1270] Such
dread is undoubtedly one of the most powerful motives of human
action. Speaking of the Greenlanders, Cranz says that the mainspring
of all that they do is their fear of being blamed or mocked by other
men.[1271] Among savages, custom is a tyrant as potent as law has
ever been in civilized societies, every deviation from a usage which
has taken root among the people being laughed to scorn, or regarded
with disdain. The young ladies of Balonda, wholly unconscious of
their own deficiency, could not maintain their gravity at the sight
of the naked backs of Livingstone’s men. “Much to the annoyance of
my companions,” he says, “the young girls laughed outright whenever
their backs were turned to them, for the Balonda men wear a dress
consisting of skins of small animals, hanging before and behind from
a girdle round the loins.”[1272] By degrees a custom is associated
with religion, and then becomes even more powerful than before. Mr.
Williams tells us of a Fijian priest, who, like all his countrymen,
was satisfied with a “masi,” or scanty hip-cloth, but on hearing a
description of the naked inhabitants of New Caledonia and of their
idols, exclaimed, contemptuously, “Not have a ‘masi,’ and yet pretend
to have gods!”[1273] And, as Peschel remarks, “were a pious Mussulman
of Ferghana to be present at our balls, and see the bare shoulders of
our wives and daughters, and the semi-embraces of our round dances,
he would silently wonder at the long-suffering of Allah, who had
not long ago poured fire and brimstone on this sinful and shameless
generation.”[1274]

Covering the nakedness has, for the reason already pointed out, become
a very common practice among savage peoples; among those of the
tropics, no other sort of clothing is generally in use. Hence, through
the power of custom, the feeling of shame aroused by the exposure of
the nakedness. If this is the true explanation, some may be disposed to
infer that savages who, for the sake of cold, cover almost the entire
body, will feel ashamed to bare even such parts as may elsewhere be
shown without compunction. But this would be to overlook the essential
fact that the heat of their dwellings, where they spend most of the
winter, and the warmth of the summer sun, in many cases make it
necessary for them, as they think, to throw off all their clothes.
When this is done, they seem to be devoid of any sense of shame. Thus,
the Aleuts undress themselves completely in their warm jurts, and
men and women have for ages been accustomed to bathe together in the
sea; “they do not think of there being any immodesty in it, yet, any
immorality is exceedingly rare among them.”[1275] The Tacullies, who
usually take off their clothes in summer, though they are well clad
in winter, manifest, according to Harmon, as little sense of shame
in regard to uncovering “as the very brute creation.”[1276] The
Eskimo of Etah, who in the winter are enveloped to the face in furs,
nevertheless, according to Kane’s description, completely put aside
their garments in their subterranean dwellings;[1277] and the demeanour
of the wife of Hans the Eskimo on board Hayes’s ship, plainly showed
that she had no idea of decency.[1278]

On the other hand, we know that peoples living in warm climates
who cover only the nakedness are utterly ashamed to expose it. The
Andamanese, although they wear as little clothing as possible, exhibit
a delicacy that amounts to prudishness, the women of the tribes of
South Andaman being so modest that they will not remove their small
apron of leaves, or put anything in its place, in the presence of any
person, even of their own sex.[1279] Speaking of the Fijians, Wilkes
asserts that, “though almost naked, these natives have a great idea
of modesty, and consider it extremely indelicate to expose the whole
person. If either a man or woman should be discovered without the
‘maro,’ or ‘liku,’ they would probably be killed.”[1280] The female
natives of Nukahiva have only one small covering, but are so tenacious
of it that the most licentious will not consent to take it off.[1281]
Among those Australian tribes, in which a covering is worn by the
women, they will retire out of sight to bathe.[1282] In Lukunor and
Radack, men and women never appear naked together;[1283] and among
the Pelew Islanders, according to Semper, the women have an unlimited
privilege of striking, fining, or, if it be done on the spot, killing
any man who makes his way in to their bathing-places.[1284]

These facts appear to prove that the feeling of shame, far from being
the original cause of man’s covering his body, is, on the contrary,
a result of this custom; and that the covering, if not used as a
protection from the climate, owes its origin, at least in a great many
cases, to the desire of men and women to make themselves mutually
attractive.[1285] To some readers it may perhaps seem probable that the
covering of the nakedness was originally due to the feeling which makes
intimate relations between the sexes, even among savages, a more or
less secret matter. But, whilst this feeling is universal in mankind,
there are, as we have seen, a great many peoples who attach no idea
of shame to the entire exposure of the body, and these peoples are
otherwise not less modest than those who cover themselves. Their number
is, indeed, so great that we cannot regard the absence of shame as a
reversion or perversion; and it may be asserted with perfect confidence
that the modesty which shows itself in covering is not an instinct in
the same sense as that in which the aversion to incest, for example,
is an instinct,—an aversion to which sexual bashfulness seems to be
very closely related. Travellers have observed that, among various
naked tribes, women exhibit a strong sense of modesty through various
attitudes. But these attitudes may, like concealment by clothing, have
been _originally_ due to coquetry. They imply a vivid consciousness of
certain facts, and the exhibition of this consciousness is far from
being a mark of modesty. It may, further, be supposed that decent
covering was adopted for the protection of parts specially liable to
injury. This may hold good for some cases; but the general prevalence
of circumcision even among naked tribes shows that savages are not
particularly anxious about the safety of their persons.




CHAPTER X

THE LIBERTY OF CHOICE.


It would be easy to adduce numerous instances of savage and barbarous
tribes among whom a girl is far from having the entire disposal of
her own hand. Being regarded as an object of property, she is treated
accordingly.

Among many peoples the female children are usually “engaged”
in their earliest youth. Concerning the Eskimo to the north of
Churchill, Franklin states that, “as soon as a girl is born, the
young lad who wishes to have her for a wife goes to her father’s
tent and proffers himself. If accepted, a promise is given which is
considered binding, and the girl is delivered to her betrothed at
the proper age.”[1286] Early betrothals are among the established
customs of the Chippewyans,[1287] Columbians,[1288] Botocudos,[1289]
Patagonians,[1290] and other American peoples.[1291] Among the African
Marutse, the children “are often affianced at an early age, and the
marriage is consummated as soon as the girl arrives at maturity.”[1292]
The Negroes of the Gold Coast, according to Bosman, often arranged for
the marriage of infants directly after birth;[1293] whilst, among the
Bushmans, Bechuanas, and Ashantees, children are engaged when they are
still in the womb, in the event of their proving to be girls.[1294]

In Australia, too, girls are frequently promised in early youth, and
sometimes before they are born.[1295] The same is the case in New
Guinea,[1296] New Zealand,[1297] Tahiti,[1298] and many other islands
of the South Sea, as also among several of the tribes inhabiting
the Malay Archipelago.[1299] Mariner supposed that, in Tonga, about
one-third of the married women had been thus betrothed.[1300] In
British India infant-marriage has hitherto been a common custom; and
all peoples of the Turkish stock, according to Professor Vámbéry,
are in the habit of betrothing babies.[1301] So also are the
Samoyedes[1302] and Tuski;[1303] and among the Jews of Western Russia,
parents betroth the children whom they hope to have.[1304]

Among some peoples, it is the mother,[1305] brother,[1306] or maternal
uncle,[1307] who has the chief power of giving a girl in marriage. In
Timor-laut, Mr. Forbes says, “nothing can be done of such import as
the disposal of a daughter without the advice, assistance, and witness
of all the villagers, women and youths being admitted as freely to
speak as the elder males;”[1308] and in West Australia, according to
Mr. Oldfield, the consent of the whole tribe is necessary for a girl’s
marriage.[1309] Yet such cases are no doubt rare exceptions, and give
us no right to conclude that there ever was a time when children were
generally considered the property of the tribe, or of their maternal
kinsfolk.

It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that, among the lower
races, women are, as a rule, married without having any voice of their
own in the matter. Their liberty of selection, on the contrary, is
very considerable, and, however down-trodden, they well know how to
make their influence felt. Thus, among the Indians of North America,
numberless instances are given of woman’s liberty to choose her
husband. Schoolcraft asserts that their marriages are brought about
“sometimes with, and sometimes against, the wishes of the graver and
more prudent relatives of the parties,” the marital rite consisting
chiefly in the consent of the parties.[1310] Heckewelder quotes
instances of Indians who committed suicide because they had been
disappointed in love, the girls on whom they had fixed their choice,
and to whom they were engaged, having changed their minds, and married
other lovers.[1311] Among the Kaniagmuts, Thlinkets, and Nutkas, the
suitor has to consult the wishes of the young lady.[1312] Among the
Chippewas, according to Mr. Keating, the mothers generally settle the
preliminaries to marriage without consulting the children: but the
parties are not considered husband and wife till they have given their
consent.[1313] The Atkha Aleuts occasionally betrothed their children
to each other, but the marriage was held to be binding only after the
birth of a child.[1314] Among the Creeks, if a man desires to make a
woman his wife “conformably to the more ancient and serious custom
of the country,” he endeavours to gain her own consent by regular
courtship.[1315] Among the Pueblos,[1316] &c.,[1317] “no girl is
forced to marry against her will, however eligible her parents may
consider the match.”

As to the South American Guanas, Azara states, “Aucune femme ne
consent à se marier, sans avoir fait ses stipulations préliminaires
très-détaillées avec son prétendu, et avec son père et ses parents, à
l’égard de leur genre de vie réciproque.”[1318] In Tierra del Fuego,
according to Lieutenant Bove, the eagerness with which the women seek
for young husbands is surprising, but even more surprising is the
fact that they nearly always attain their ends.[1319] Speaking of the
same people, Mr. Bridges says, “It frequently happens that there is
insuperable aversion on the girl’s part to her husband, and she leaves
him, and if she persists in hating him she is then given to one she
likes.”[1320] It is, indeed, common in America for a girl to run away
from a bridegroom forced upon her by the parents;[1321] whilst, if they
refuse to give their daughter to a suitor whom she loves, the couple
elope.[1322] Thus, among the Dacotahs, as we are told by Mr. Prescott,
“there are many matches made by elopement, much to the chagrin of the
parents.”[1323]

In Australia it is the rule that a father alone can give away his
daughter, and, according to Mr. Curr, the woman herself has no voice
in the selection of her husband.[1324] But, with reference to the
Narrinyeri, Mr. Taplin states that, “although the consent of a female
is not considered a matter of the first importance, as, indeed, is
the case in many uncivilized nations, yet it is always regarded as
desirable.”[1325] Among the Kurnai, according to Mr. Howitt, she
decidedly enjoys the freedom of choice. Should the parents refuse their
consent, she goes away with her lover, and if they can remain away till
the girl is with child she may, it is said, expect to be forgiven.
Otherwise it may become necessary for them to elope two or three
times before they are pardoned, the family at length becoming tired
of objecting.[1326] Mr. Mathew asserts that, with varying details,
marriage by mutual consent will be found among other tribes also,
though it is not completed except by means of a run-away match.[1327]
Elopement undertaken with the consent of the woman is, indeed, and has
been, a recognized institution among at least some of the aboriginal
tribes in Australia. Among the Kurnai it is the rule.[1328]

The Maoris have a proverb, “As a kahawai (a fish which is very
particular in selecting the hook that most resembles its food) selects
the hook which pleases it best out of a great number, so also a woman
chooses one man out of many.”[1329] Mariner supposed that, in Tonga,
perhaps two-thirds of the girls had married with their own free
consent.[1330] Concerning the natives of Arorae, Mr. Turner says,
“In choosing a husband the lady sat in the lower room of the house,
and over her head were let down through the chinks of the floor of the
upper room two or three cocoa-nut leaflets, the ends of which were held
by her lovers. She pulled at one, and asked whose it was. If the reply
was not in the voice of the young man she wished to have, she left it
and pulled at another leaf, and another, until she found him, and then
pulled it right down. The happy man whose leaf she pulled down sat
still, while the others slunk away.”[1331] In the Society Islands, the
women of the middle and lower ranks had the power to choose husbands
according to their own wishes; and that the women of the highest
classes sometimes asserted the same right appears from the addresses a
chief of Eimeo had to pay to the object of his attachment before she
could be induced to accept his offer.[1332] In Radack, “marriages
depend on a free convention,” as seems to be generally the case in
Micronesia.[1333] In the New Britain Group, according to Mr. Romilly,
after the man has worked for years to pay for his wife, and is finally
in a position to take her to his house, she may refuse to go, and he
cannot claim back from the parents the large sums he has paid them in
yams, cocoa-nuts, and sugar-canes.[1334] With reference to the New
Caledonian girl, M. Moncelon remarks, “Elle est consultée quelquefois,
mais souvent est forcée d’obéir. Alors elle fuit à chaque instant pour
rejoindre l’homme qu’elle préfère.”[1335]

In the Indian Archipelago, according to Professor Wilken, most
marriages are contracted by the mutual consent of the parties.[1336]
Among the Dyaks, “the unmarried girls are at perfect liberty to choose
their mates.”[1337] In some parts of Java, much deference is paid to
the bride’s inclinations;[1338] and, among the Minahassers of Celebes,
courtship or love-making “is always strictly an affair of the heart
and not in any way dependent upon the consent or even wish of the
parents.”[1339] Similar statements are made by Riedel with reference
to several of the smaller islands.[1340] Among the Rejangs of Sumatra,
if a young man runs away with a virgin without the consent of her
father, he does not act contrary to the laws of the country; and, if he
is willing to make the usual payments afterwards, the woman cannot be
reclaimed by her father or other kinsfolk.[1341]

In Burma, “the choice of marriageable girls is perfectly free,” and
marriages are occasionally contracted even in direct opposition to
the parents.[1342] Among the Shans, mutual consent is required to
constitute a valid union;[1343] and, regarding the Chittagong Hill
tribes, Captain Lewin says that the women’s “power of selecting
their own husband is to the full as free as that enjoyed by our own
English maidens.”[1344] The same is the case with many, perhaps most,
of the uncivilized tribes of India. The young couple often settle
the affair entirely between themselves, even though marriages are
ostensibly arranged by the parents;[1345] or the parents, before
they give their children in marriage, consult them, and, as a rule,
follow their likings.[1346] In case of parental objection, elopements
frequently take place.[1347] Among the Kukis, a girl who runs away
from a husband she does not like is not thought to act wrongly in doing
so.[1348] Among the aboriginal tribes of China,[1349] the Ainos,[1350]
Khamchadales,[1351] Jakuts,[1352] Ossetes,[1353] &c.,[1354] the
daughter’s inclinations are nearly always consulted. And, in Corea,
mutual choice was the ancient custom of the country.[1355]

Turning to Africa we find that, among the Touaregs, a girl may select
out of her suitors the one whom she herself prefers.[1356] As to
the West African negroes, Mr. Reade informed Mr. Darwin that “the
women, at least among the more intelligent Pagan tribes, have no
difficulty in getting the husbands whom they may desire, although
it is considered unwomanly to ask a man to marry them.”[1357] The
accuracy of this statement is confirmed by several travellers,[1358]
and it seems to hold good for other parts of Africa. Among the Shulis,
according to Dr. Felkin, the women have a voice in the selection of
their husbands.[1359] The Mádi girls, says Emin Pasha, enjoy great
freedom, and are able to choose companions to their liking.[1360]
Among the Marutse, “free women who have not been given away or sold
as slaves are allowed to choose what husbands they please.”[1361] The
young Kafirs endeavour generally at first to gain the consent of the
girls, for it is, as Mr. Leslie remarks, “a mistake to imagine that
a girl is sold by her father in the same manner, and with the same
authority, with which he would dispose of a cow.”[1362] And, among
the Hottentots[1363] and Bushmans,[1364] when a girl has grown up to
womanhood without having previously been betrothed, her lover must gain
her approbation, as well as that of the parents.

In works by ancient writers we find statements of the same kind. Among
the Cathæi, according to Strabo, the girls chose their husbands, and
the young men their wives;[1365] and the same is said by Herodotus
of the women of Lydia.[1366] In Indian and old Scandinavian tales
virgins are represented as having the power to dispose of themselves
freely.[1367] Thus it was agreed that Skade should choose for herself a
husband among the Asas, but she was to make her choice by the feet, the
only part of their persons she was allowed to see.[1368]

In view of such facts it is impossible to agree with M. Letourneau
that, during a very long period, woman was married without her wishes
being at all consulted.[1369] There can be no doubt that, under more
primitive conditions, she was even more free in that respect than
she is now among most of the lower races. At present a daughter is
very commonly an object of trade, and the more exclusively she is
regarded from this point of view, the less, of course, are her own
likings taken into account. Among the Bedouins of Mount Sinai, who
have marriage by purpose, no father thinks it necessary to consult his
daughter before selling her, whereas, among the Arabs of the eastern
plain, the Aenezes, &c., according to Burckhardt, “the father never
receives the price of the girl, and therefore some regard is paid
to her inclinations.”[1370] But it will be shown that marriage by
purchase forms a comparatively late stage in the history of the family
relations of mankind, owing its origin to the fact that daughters
are valuable as labourers, and therefore not given away for nothing.
Speaking of the Gippsland natives, Mr. Fison says, “The assertion
that women ‘eat and do not hunt’ cannot apply to the lower savages.
On the contrary, whether among the ruder agricultural tribes or those
who are dependent on supplies gathered from the ‘forest and the
flood,’ the women are food-providers, who supply to the full as much
as they consume, and render valuable service into the bargain. In
times of peace, as a general rule, they are the hardest workers and
the most useful members of the community.”[1371] Now, the Australians,
although a very rude race, have advanced far beyond the original
state of man. There is no reason to doubt that, among our earliest
human ancestors, the possession of a woman was desired only for the
gratification of the man’s passions. It may be said generally that in a
state of nature every grown-up individual earns his own living. Hence
there is no slavery, as there is, properly speaking, no labour. A man
in the earliest times had no reason, then, to retain his full-grown
daughter; she might go away, and marry at her pleasure. That she was
not necessarily gained by the very first male, we may conclude from
what we know about the lower animals. As Mr. Darwin remarks, the female
generally, or at least often, exerts some choice. She can in most cases
escape, if wooed by a male who does not please her, and when pursued,
as commonly occurs, by several males, she seems often to have the
opportunity, whilst they are fighting with one another, of going away
with, or at least of temporarily paring with, some one male.[1372]

It might be supposed that at a later stage, when family ties grew
stronger, and bride-stealing became a common way of concluding a
marriage, the consent of the woman in the event of capture would be
quite out of the question. Certainly it must generally have been
so when she fell as a booty into the hands of an enemy. But women
thus captured may in many cases have been able to escape from the
husbands forced on them, and to return to their own, or some friendly
neighbouring, tribe. Very frequently, however, bride-stealing seems to
have taken place with the approval of the girl, there being no other
way in which the match could be concluded if her parents were not
willing to agree to it. It is a common mistake, as Mr. Howitt remarks,
to confound marriage by capture and marriage by elopement. They are
essentially different, the one being effected without, the other
with, the woman’s consent.[1373] Thus, among the Australians, many,
perhaps most, cases of so-called bride-stealing come under the head of
elopements.[1374]

Something remains to be said as to the position of sons among
uncivilized peoples. When young they are everywhere as much dependent
on the parents, or at least on the father, as are their sisters. A
boy may be sold, bartered away, or even killed, if his father thinks
proper. That the power of life and death, under certain circumstances,
rests with the tribe is a matter of little importance in this
connection. But as soon as the young man grows up, the father, as a
rule, has no longer any authority over him, whereas a woman is always
more or less in a state of dependence, marriage implying for her a
change of owner only. Among the Australians, says Mr. Curr, “sons
become independent when they have gone through the ceremonies by
which they attain to the _status_ of manhood.”[1375] The full-grown
man is his own master; he is strong enough not to be kept in check by
his father, and, being able to shift for himself, he may marry quite
independently of the old man’s will.

It often happens, indeed, as we have seen, that parents betroth their
children when they are young.[1376] But, if such an engagement is not
always binding even for the woman, it is of course all the less so
for the man. “The choice among the Kalmucks,” Liadov says, “belongs
entirely to the parents. Still, there is no constraint upon this point,
and, if the son declares that the selection of his parents displease
him, there is no further question about the matter.”[1377]

Moreover, marriage contracts are concluded among certain peoples by the
parents of the parties, even when these are full-grown.[1378] Among
the Iroquois, according to Mr. Morgan, the mother, when she considered
her son of a suitable age for marriage, looked about for a maiden whom
she thought likely to accord with him in disposition and temperament,
and remonstrance or objection on the part of the children was never
attempted.[1379] Among the Basutos, the choice of “the great wife” is
generally made by the father.[1380] And, in many of the uncivilized
tribes of India, parents are in the habit of betrothing their
sons.[1381] In certain cases, the parents merely go through a form of
selection, the matter having already been really settled by the parties
concerned;[1382] and usually a man who has been induced to marry a
woman he does not like, may divorce her and choose another according
to his taste. Yet, speaking of the Kisáns, Colonel Dalton says that
“there is no instance on record of a youth or maiden objecting to the
arrangement made for them.”[1383] The paternal authority among these
tribes of India implies, indeed, a family system of higher type than
we are accustomed to find among wild races: it approaches the _patria
potestas_ of the ancient Aryan nations. Thus, among the Kandhs, in
each family the absolute authority rests with the house-father; the
sons have no property during the father’s lifetime, and all the male
children, with their wives and descendants, continue to share the
father’s meal, prepared by the common mother.[1384] The father chooses
a full-grown woman as a wife for his young son. “In the superior
age of the bride,” says Colonel Macpherson, “is seen a proof of the
supremacy of the paternal authority amongst this singular people. The
parents obtain the wives of their sons during their boyhood, as very
valuable domestic servants, and their selections are avowedly made with
a view to utility in this character.”[1385]

Among savages the father’s power depends exclusively, or chiefly, upon
his superior strength. At a later stage, in connection with a more
highly developed system of ancestor-worship, it becomes more ideal,
and, at the same time, more extensive and more absolute. Obedience to
the father is regarded as a sacred duty, the transgression of which
will be punished as a crime against the gods. Indeed, so prevalent
has this strengthened authority of the father been among peoples who
have reached a relatively high degree of civilization, that it must be
regarded as marking a stage in all human history.

The family system of the savage Indians differs widely, in this
respect, from that which was established among the ancient inhabitants
of Mexico and Peru. Concerning the Mexicans, Clavigero says that
“their children were bred to stand so much in awe of their parents,
that, even when grown up and married they hardly durst speak before
them.”[1386] The following was an exhortation of a Mexican to his
son:—“Honour all persons, particularly thy parents, to whom thou
owest obedience, respect, and service. Guard against imitating the
example of those wicked sons, who, like brutes that are deprived of
reason, neither reverence their parents, listen to their instruction,
nor submit to their correction; because whoever follows their steps
will have an unhappy end, will die in a desperate or sudden manner, or
will be killed and devoured by wild beasts.”[1387] A youth was seldom
allowed to choose a wife for himself; he was expected to abide by the
selection of his parents. Hence it rarely happened that a marriage
took place without the sanction of parents or other kinsfolk, and he
who presumed to marry without such sanction had to undergo penance,
being looked upon as ungrateful, ill-bred, and apostate.[1388] The
belief was, according to Torquemada, that an act of that kind would
be punished by some misfortune.[1389] In a province of the Mexican
empire, it was even required that a bridegroom should be carried, that
he might be supposed to marry against his inclinations.[1390] Touching
the Guatemalans, Mr. Bancroft says, “It seems incredible that the
young men should have quietly submitted to having their wives picked
out for them without being allowed any voice or choice in the matter.
Yet we are told that so great was their obedience and submission to
their parents that there never was any scandal in these things.”[1391]
In the greater part of Nicaragua, matches were arranged by the parents;
though there were certain independent towns in which the girls chose
their husbands from among the young men, while the latter sat at a
feast.[1392] Again, in Peru, Inca Pachacutec confirmed the law that
sons should obey and serve their fathers until they reached the age
of twenty-five, and that none should marry without the consent of
the parents, and of the parents of the girl, a marriage without this
consent being invalid and the children illegitimate.[1393]

Similar ideas formerly prevailed, and to some extent are still found,
among the civilized nations of the Old World. The Chinese have a maxim
that, as the Emperor should have a father’s love for his people, so a
father should have a sovereign’s power over his family.[1394] From
earliest youth the Chinese lad is imbued with such respect for his
parents that it becomes at last a religious sentiment, and forms, as he
gets older, the basis of his only creed—the worship of ancestors.[1395]
Disobedience to parents is looked upon as a sin to be punished with
death, whether the offender be an infant or a full-grown son or
daughter. And in everything referring to the marriage of the children
parents are omnipotent. “From all antiquity in China,” Navarette
says, “no son ever did, or hereafter will, marry without the consent
of his parents.”[1396] Indeed, according to Mr. Medhurst, it is a
universally acknowledged principle in China that no person, of whatever
age, can act for himself in matrimonial matters during the lifetime
or in the neighbourhood of his parents or near senior kinsfolk. The
power of these guardians is so great that they may contract a marriage
for a junior who is absent from home, and he is bound to abide by
such engagement even though already affianced elsewhere without their
privity or consent.[1397] The consequence of this system is that,
in many cases, the betrothed couple scarcely know each other before
marriage, the wedding being the first occasion on which the man catches
a glimpse of his wife’s face.[1398] In some parts of the Empire
children are affianced in infancy.[1399]

In Japan, according to Professor Rein, a house-father enjoyed the
same extensive rights as the Roman _paterfamilias_—an unlimited power
over the person and property of his children.[1400] Filial piety is
considered the highest duty of man, and not even death or the marriage
relation weakens, to any great extent, the hold of a father on a child.
“With affection on the one hand, and cunning on the other,” says Mr.
Griffis, “an unscrupulous father may do what he will.... The Japanese
maiden, as pure as the purest Christian virgin, will, at the command
of her father, enter the brothel to-morrow, and prostitute herself for
life. Not a murmur escapes her lips as she thus filially obeys.”[1401]
Marriages are almost invariably arranged by the parents or nearest
kinsfolk of the parties, or by the parties themselves with the aid
of an agent or middleman known as the “nakōdo,” it being considered
highly improper for them to arrange it on their own account. Among the
lower classes, such direct unions are not unfrequent; but they are held
in contempt, and are known as “yagō,” _i.e._, “meeting on a moor,”—a
term of disrespect showing the low opinion entertained of them. The
middleman’s duty consists in acquainting each of the parties with the
nature, habits, good and bad qualities, and bodily infirmities of the
other, and in doing his utmost to bring the affair to a successful
conclusion. It seldom happens that the parties immediately interested
communicate directly with the middleman; if they have parents or
guardians, it is done by these, and, if not, by the nearest relation.
The middleman has to arrange for a meeting between the parties, which
meeting is known as the “mi ai,” literally “see meeting” and, if
either party is dissatisfied with the other after this introduction,
the matter proceeds no further. But, formerly, says Mr. Küchler, “this
ante-nuptial meeting was dispensed with in the case of people of very
exalted rank, who consequently never saw each other until the bride
removed her veil on the marriage day.”[1402]

Among the ancient Arabs[1403] and Hebrews, fathers exercised very great
rights over their families. According to the old law of Jahveism, a
father might sell his child to relieve his own distress, or offer it
to a creditor as a pledge.[1404] Death was the penalty for a child who
struck a parent, or even cursed one;[1405] though the father himself
could not inflict this penalty on his children, but had to appeal to
the whole community.[1406] How important were the duties of the child
to the parents, is shown in the primitive typical relation of Isaac
to Abraham, and may, as Ewald remarks, be at once learned from the
placing of the law on the subject among the Ten Commandments, and from
its position there in immediate proximity to the commands relating to
the duties of man towards God.[1407] According to Michaelis, there is
nowhere the slightest trace of its having been the will of Moses that
paternal authority and the subjection of sons should cease after a
certain age.[1408] A Hebrew father not only disposed of his daughter’s
hand, but chose wives for his sons,—the selection, however, being
sometimes made by the mother.[1409]

Judging from the marked severity of filial duties among the Egyptians,
some of which are distinctly alluded to in the inscription of Thebes,
we may conclude that, in Egypt, much more was expected from a son than
in any European nation of the present day.[1410] And in the ‘Precepts
of Ptah-Hotep,’ which have been called “the most ancient book in
the world,” we read that the father ought to command, the son to
obey:—“The son who accepts the word of his father will attain old age
on that account. God wishes us to obey; disobedience is abhorrent to
Him.”[1411]

Among the Romans, the house-father had, in the earlier time, the _jus
vitae necisque_—the power of life and death—over his children. He
could imprison, sell, or kill his children under an express law of
the Twelve Tables;[1412] and Plutarch says Brutus condemned his sons
to death, without judicial forms, not as consul, but as father.[1413]
“All in the household,” Mommsen remarks, “were destitute of legal
rights—the wife and the child no less than the bullock or the
slave.”[1414] Even the full-grown son and his children were subject to
the house-father’s will,[1415] and in marriage without _conventio in
manum_ a daughter remained in the power of her father or tutor after
marriage. The consent of the _paterfamilias_ was indispensable to the
marriage of children, sons and daughters alike;[1416] and so strict
was this rule originally, that down to the reign of Marcus Aurelius
the children of a _mente captus_ could not contract a legal marriage
while in the power of their father, the latter being incapable of
giving his consent.[1417] The religious character of this unlimited
paternal authority has been pointed out by M. Fustel de Coulanges. “In
primitive antiquity,” he says, “the father is not only the strong man,
the protector who has power to command obedience; he is the priest, he
is heir to the hearth, the continuator of the ancestors, the parent
stock of the descendants, the depositary of the mysterious rites of
worship, and of the sacred formulas of prayer. The whole religion
resides in him.”[1418]

It has been suggested by Sir Henry Maine and others that the _patria
potestas_ of the Romans was a survival of the paternal authority
which existed among the primitive Aryans.[1419] But no clear evidence
of the general prevalence of such unlimited authority among other
Indo-European peoples has been adduced. Justinian justly observed,
“The power which we have over our children is peculiar to Roman
citizens; for there are no other men possessing such a power over
their children as we have.”[1420] That the father, among the Greeks,
Germans, and Celts, had the power to expose his children when they
were very young and to sell his marriageable daughters, does not imply
the possession of a sovereignty like that which the Roman house-father
exercised over his descendants at all ages. As, however, the family
institution seems to have had a religious basis among the early
Aryans, the father probably had a higher authority than he has among
any existing uncivilized people.

According to Sir Henry Maine, the fulness of the ancient Hindu
_patria potestas_ may be safely inferred from the veneration
which even a living father must have inspired under a system of
ancestor-worship.[1421] At a later date, the law-book of Manu declares
that three persons—a wife, a son, and a slave—have in general no wealth
exclusively their own; the wealth which they may earn being regularly
acquired for the man to whom they belong.[1422] A more recent, but
still ancient authority, Narada, says that a son is “of age and
independent, in case his parents be dead; during their lifetime he
is dependent, even though he be grown old.”[1423] And, speaking of
the South of India, Mr. Nelson observes, “It is an undoubted fact
that, amongst the so-called Hindus of the Madras Province, the father
is looked upon by all at the present day as the Rajah or absolute
Sovereign of the family that depends upon him. He is entitled to
reverence during his life, as he is to worship after his death. His
word is law, to be obeyed without question or demur. He is emphatically
the ‘Master’ of his family, of his wife, of his sons, of his slaves,
and of his wealth.”[1424] But, on the other hand, it appears from
the ‘Rig-Veda’ that, among the ancient Hindus, the father was the
head of the family only as long as he was able to be its protector
and maintainer,[1425] decrepit parents being even allowed to die of
starvation,—a custom which was prevalent among the ancient Teutons
and Eranians.[1426] Moreover, according to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ a
daughter might choose her husband in accordance with her own wish.
This permission, however, seems to have been an innovation, as Manu
himself disapproves of such a “voluntary union of a maiden and her
lover, ... which springs from desire and has sexual intercourse for
its purpose.”[1427] The four marriages—Brâhma, Daiva, Ârsha, and
Prâgâpatya—in which the father gives away his daughter, are blessed
marriages, and from them spring sons radiant with knowledge of the
Veda, honoured by good men, and destined to live a hundred years. But
the remaining four marriages—those effected by purchase, voluntary
union, forcible abduction, or stealth—are blamable marriages, from
which spring sons who are cruel and untruthful, who hate the Veda
and the sacred law.[1428] Among the ancient Persians also, marriage
contracted with the woman’s own consent, but against the will of her
parents, was looked upon as the worst kind of marriage.[1429] In
India,[1430] as well as in Persia,[1431] children were often affianced
in earliest youth by their parents.

According to M. Fustel de Coulanges, the unlimited subjection of the
son to the father existed amongst the ancient Greeks, but disappeared
at an early period at Athens, and somewhat later at Sparta.[1432] It
seems very doubtful, however, whether this subjection ever was so
unlimited as among the Romans. The relations of Ulysses and Laertes
in the Odyssey indicate that, at least under certain circumstances, a
father in the decrepitude of age could be deposed from the headship
of the family. In the mature Greek jurisprudence, as Sir Henry Maine
points out, the direct authority of the parent is restricted, as in
European codes, to the nonage or minority of the children.[1433] At
Athens, a son was in his father’s power till twenty years of age; then
he could marry without paternal sanction.[1434] Women, on the other
hand, were in a state of nonage throughout life. A woman could not be
a party to any act of importance without the consent of her guardians,
whose rights, after her marriage, passed to the husband. As a rule, it
was the lot of a Greek woman to be given in marriage to a man whom
she did not know.[1435] “Les femmes, à Athènes,” says M. Cauvet, “ne
devaient jamais choisir elles-mêmes leur époux, toujours il leur était
par le tuteur que la loi leur donnait.”[1436] At Sparta, as well as
at Athens, the betrothal of the bride by her father or guardian was
requisite as an introduction to marriage.[1437]

Among the Teutons, the father certainly had the power to expose or
sell his children under age, but an adult son could put his infirm and
aged parents to death.[1438] “Quelle que soit la ressemblance des
deux institutions,” says M. Laboulaye, “on ne peut pas confondre la
puissance paternelle (_patria potestas_) des Romains et la puissance
paternelle des barbares, le _mundium_.”[1439] Far from being, as in
Rome, a power throughout life, the _mundium_ over a son ceased as soon
as he was able to shift for himself.[1440] M. Pardessus asserts that,
at any rate in the fifth and sixth centuries, such paternal authority
as a Roman father exerted did not exist among the Franks;[1441] and an
old commentator states that, “by the law of the Langobardi, children
are not under the ‘power’ of the father.” Nevertheless, the _mundium_
among these people was more severe than among any other of the Teutonic
nations.[1442] The extent of the father’s rights in earlier times,
when the Teutons had no written laws, we do not definitely know; but,
according to Tacitus, a house-father had not unlimited power even over
his slaves;[1443] so it is impossible to believe in the prevalence of
a _patria potestas_ of the Roman type among them. In choosing a wife,
however, the men had apparently in early days to take counsel with
their kinsfolk.[1444] “The parents and relations of the parties,”
says Tacitus, “are consulted in cases of marriage, and determine the
nature of the bridal gifts.”[1445] Women always remained in a state of
dependence. Girls, wives, or widows, they were under the guardianship
of the father, husband, or nearest male relative. The father could
freely dispose of his daughter’s hand, and her own inclinations seem to
have been very little taken into consideration.[1446]

According to ancient Russian laws, fathers had great power over the
children;[1447] but Macieiowski thinks it improbable that a son could
be sold as a slave.[1448] Baron von Haxthausen, who wrote before the
Emancipation in 1861, says, “The patriarchal government, feelings, and
organization are in full activity in the life, manners, and customs
of the Great Russians. The same unlimited authority which the father
exercises over all his children is possessed by the mother over her
daughters.... The Russian addresses the same word to his real father,
to the Starosta (a communal authority), to his proprietor, to the
Emperor, and finally to God, _viz._, Father (‘Batushka’).”[1449]
According to Sir Mackenzie Wallace, however, the head of the
household was rather the administrator of a labour association than
a house-father in the proper sense of the term. The house and nearly
everything it contained were the joint-property of the family, and not
even the head of it could sell or buy anything without the express or
tacit consent of all the other grown-up men.[1450] In Poland, according
to Nestor, a father used to select a bride for his son;[1451] and
in Russia, previous to the Emancipation, it was a common custom for
fathers to marry their young sons to full-grown women. According to
Professor Bogišić, the power of the father is not so great among the
South Slavonians as among the Russians.[1452] But Dr. Krauss asserts
that a son is not permitted to make a proposal of marriage to a girl
against the will of his parents; and, among the Croatians and Servians,
it is quite exceptional for the young man himself to look about for his
future wife.[1453] A daughter, of course, enjoys still less freedom of
disposing of her own hand.[1454]

The paternal authority of the archaic type here considered formed
only a transitional stage in the history of human institutions. It
declined gradually, according as the religious basis on which it rested
became more unstable. The introduction of a new religion with higher
conceptions of human rights particularly contributed to its fall.
Paying special attention to its influence on the laws of marriage, I
shall endeavour to trace the main features of this highly important
process, which released children from paternal despotism.

Among the Hebrews, a modification of the patriarchal principle
took place as early as the seventh century before the Christian
era;[1455] and, according to the Talmudic law, a marriage, to be
valid, must be contracted with the voluntary consent of both the
parties concerned.[1456] In Arabia, Mohammed limited the paternal
power.[1457] According to all the Mohammedan schools, a son is at
liberty to contract a marriage without his father’s consent, after he
has completed his fifteenth year. The Hanafîs and Shiahs grant the same
privilege to a daughter, whereas, according to other schools, a woman
is emancipated from paternal control only through marriage.[1458] A
Mohammedan father certainly has the right to impose the _status_ of
marriage on his children during their minority, sons and daughters
alike, but the law takes particular care that this right shall never be
exercised to the prejudice of the infant. Any act of the father which
is likely to injure the interest of the minor is considered illegal,
and entitles the judge to interfere in order to prevent the completion
of such act, or, if complete, to annul it.[1459]

In the mature Greek jurisprudence the paternal power was more
restricted than during the Homeric age;[1460] and the Roman _patria
potestas_ gradually became a shadow of what it had been. Under the
Republic the abuses of paternal authority were checked by the censors,
and in later times the Emperors reduced the father’s power within
comparatively narrow limits. Alexander Severus ordained that severe
punishments should be inflicted on members of a family only by the
magistrate. Diocletian and Maximilian took away the power of selling
freeborn children as slaves; and Constantine declared the father who
killed his child guilty of murder.[1461] The father’s privilege of
dictating marriage for his sons declined into a conditional veto;[1462]
and it seems as if daughters also, at length, gained a certain amount
of freedom in the choice of a husband. At any rate, a daughter could
protest, if the father wished to give her in marriage to a man with a
bad reputation.[1463]

“La philosophie stoïcienne et le christianisme,” says M.
Koenigswarter, “qui hâtèrent le développement des principes d’égalité,
furent surtout favorables aux fils de famille et aux femmes.”[1464] The
influence of Christianity shows itself in Teutonic legislation as well
as in Roman. An edict of Clothaire I. in 560 prohibited the forcing
of women to marry against their will;[1465] although a Council held
at Paris three years earlier expressly required the consent of the
parents also.[1466] According to the laws of Cnut, no woman or girl
could be forced to marry a man whom she disliked.[1467] The Swedish
‘Westgöta-lag’ permitted a woman to dissolve a marriage which had
been contracted without her consent;[1468] and similar privileges were
granted to her in the ‘Uplands-lag’[1469] and certain other Teutonic
law-books.[1470] Later on, the ‘Schwabenspiegel’—a faithful echo of
canonical ideas—says, “When a young man has completed his fourteenth
year, he can take a wife without the consent of his father.... At
twelve years, a maiden is marriageable; and the marriage subsists, even
if contracted in spite of her father, or other relatives.”[1471] A
similar privilege, during the Middle Ages, was granted to German women
in general.[1472] But the feelings of the people seemed to have been
opposed to it, and required the consent of the parents. Thus Ulrich von
Lichtenstein says in his ‘Frauenbuch,’ “A girl who has no parents
should follow the advice of her kinsfolk; if she gives herself to a man
of her own accord, she may live with shame.”[1473]

Paternal authority has declined more rapidly in some countries than
in others. The process has been especially slow in France. In the
literature of the eleventh century, says M. Bernard, the paternal
character is “everywhere honoured, and filial piety everywhere
praised and rewarded. In the romances of chivalry fathers are never
ridiculous; nor sons insolent and mocking.... Above the majesty of
the feudal baron, that of the paternal power was held still more
sacred and inviolable. However powerful the son might be, he would
not have dared to outrage his father, whose authority was in his eyes
always confounded with the sovereignty of command.”[1474] This respect
exercised a tyrannical dominion for centuries. Du Vair remarks, “Nous
devons tenir nos pères comme des dieux en terre.”[1475] Bodin wrote,
in the later part of the sixteenth century, that, though the monarch
commands his subjects, the master his disciples, the captain his
soldiers, there is none to whom nature has given any command except the
father, “who is the true image of the great sovereign God, universal
father of all things.”[1476] In the Duke of Sully’s ‘Memoirs’ we read
that, in his days in France, children were not permitted to sit in
the presence of their parents without being commanded to do so.[1477]
According to the edicts of Henry III. (1566), Louis XIII. (1639), and
Louis XIV. (1697), sons could not marry before the age of thirty, nor
daughters before that of twenty-five, without the consent of the father
and mother, on pain of being disinherited.[1478] Speaking of the women
among the nobility and upper classes in France during the eighteenth
century, Messrs. de Goncourt remark, “Généralement le mariage de la
jeune fille se faisait presque immédiatement au sortir du couvent, avec
un mari accepté et agréé par la famille. Car le mariage était avant
tout une affaire de famille, un arrangement au gré des parents, qui
décidaient des considérations de position et d’argent, des convenances
de rang et de fortune. Le choix était fait d’avance pour la jeune
personne, qui n’était pas consultée.”[1479]

Even now French law accords considerable power to parents. A child
cannot quit the paternal residence without the permission of the father
before the age of twenty-one except for enrolment in the army.[1480]
For grave misconduct by his children the father has strong means
of correction.[1481] A son under twenty-five and a daughter under
twenty-one cannot marry without the consent of their parents;[1482]
and, even when a man has attained his twenty-fifth year, and the woman
her twenty-first, both are still bound to ask for it, by a formal
notification.[1483] Parental restraints upon marriage exist to a very
great extent in Germany and Holland also, the marriage of minors being
absolutely void, if effected without the consent of the father, or of
the mother if she be the survivor. According to American, Scotch, and
Irish law, on the other hand, the consent of parents and guardians to
the marriage of minors is not requisite to the validity of the union.
The same was the case in England prior to the statute of 26 Geo. II.
c. 33, which declared all marriages by license, when either of the
parties was under the age of twenty-one years, if celebrated without
publication of banns, or without the consent of the father or unmarried
mother, or guardian to be absolutely null and void.[1484]

There is thus a certain resemblance between the family institution of
savage tribes and that of the most advanced races. Among both, the
grown-up son, and frequently the grown-up daughter, enjoys a liberty
unknown among peoples at an intermediate stage of civilization. There
are, however, these vital differences:—that children in civilized
countries are in no respect the property of their parents; that they
are born with certain rights guaranteed to them by society; that the
birth of children gives parents no rights over them other than those
which conduce to the children’s happiness. These ideas, essential as
they are to true civilization, are not many centuries old. It is a
purely modern conception the French Encyclopedist expresses when he
says, “Le pouvoir paternel est plutôt un devoir qu’un pouvoir.”[1485]




CHAPTER XI

SEXUAL SELECTION AMONG ANIMALS


The expression, “Sexual Selection,” was first used by Mr. Darwin.
Besides natural selection, which depends on the success of both
sexes, at all ages, in relation to the general conditions of life,
he introduced another principle, sexual selection, which depends on
the success of certain individuals over others of the same sex, in
relation to the propagation of the species. According to the former
principle, those individuals who are most successful in the struggle
for existence survive the others, and characters useful to the species
are thus inherited; according to the latter, those individuals who have
the greatest success in the struggle for mates have the most numerous
offspring, and the characters which gave them the preference pass on to
the new generation, and are afterwards intensified by the operation of
like causes. The sexual struggle is of two kinds. In both it is carried
on by individuals of the same sex; but in one these individuals,
generally the males, try to drive away or kill their rivals; in
the other, they seek to excite or charm those of the opposite sex,
generally the females, who select the most attractive males for their
partners. Therefore, the characters acquired through sexual selection,
and transmitted chiefly to offspring of the same sex, generally the
males, are, on the one hand, weapons for battle, vigour and courage; on
the other hand, certain colours, forms, ornaments, sounds, or odours,
which are felt to be pleasant. The secondary sexual characters of the
latter sort are thus due to the taste of the females. They have been
acquired because they are beautiful or otherwise agreeable, whereas the
characters resulting from natural selection have been acquired because
they are useful. How are we to explain the origin of this wonderful
æsthetic faculty? “The senses of man and of the lower animals,”
says Mr. Darwin, “seem to be so constituted that brilliant colours
and certain forms, as well as harmonious and rhythmical sounds, give
pleasure and are called beautiful; but why this should be so we know
not.”[1486] According to Mr. Darwin, natural and sexual selection are
two different sources from which animal characters have arisen. There
is some truth in the statement of one of his critics, “Mr. Darwin,
in fact, has so far abandoned his former belief in the efficacy
of ‘natural selection’ as an agent in producing the differences
which separate different species of animals, as to admit that some
supplementary cause must, in some cases at any rate, be looked for; and
this he thinks is to be found in the action, through long periods, of
‘sexual selection.’”[1487]

Far from co-operating with the process of natural selection, sexual
selection, as described by Mr. Darwin, produces effects disadvantageous
to the species. “It is evident,” he says, “that the brilliant
colours, top-knots, fine plumes, &c., of many male birds cannot
have been acquired as a protection; indeed, they sometimes lead to
danger.”[1488] When we consider what an important part is played by
colours, as means of protection, in the whole animal kingdom, it is
certainly surprising that many male animals display brilliant hues,
which cannot fail to make them conspicuous to their enemies. The strong
odours emitted by certain reptiles and mammals, during the pairing
season, and the sounds produced by various species at the same period,
have also the effect of attracting hostile animals that are searching
for food. And the danger arising for the species from these secondary
sexual characters is all the greater because they generally appear
at the time when offspring is about to be produced. Thus, besides
colours, structures, and functions, adapted in the most marvellous way
to the requirements of each species, there are others highly dangerous,
which, according to Mr. Darwin, depend upon an æsthetic sense, the
origin of which we do not know, and which is absolutely useless.

Mr. Darwin, in his many works, has shown how immense is the influence
exercised by natural selection on the organic world. A disciple,
therefore, naturally feels perplexed when he is told of a series of
facts, which, according to the explanation given by the master, are
opposed to natural selection. When the contradiction between the
theories of natural and sexual selection is distinctly realized, the
question arises:—Can we be sure that the secondary sexual characters
are so useless as Mr. Darwin suggests? May not they also be explained
by the principle of the survival of the fittest? The larger size and
greater strength of the males, and the weapons of offence or defence
many of them possess, may easily be so accounted for, as, among the
higher animals, the males generally fight with each other for the
possession of the females. The point is whether the other secondary
sexual characters can be due to the same cause.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is an established fact that the colours of flowers serve a definite
end. Through them the flowers are recognized by insects in search
of honey; and the insects, during their visits, involuntarily carry
the pollen of one flower to the stigma of another, and thus effect
cross-fertilization, which is proved to be of great importance for
the vigour and fertility of the next generation of plants. Now it
is extremely interesting to note that brilliant colours are found
only in species of flowers to which they are useful as means of
attracting insects; they never occur in plants which are fertilized
by the wind.[1489] Mr. Wallace observes that plants rarely need to be
concealed, because they obtain protection by their spines, or their
hardness, or their hairy covering, or their poisonous secretions.
Hence there are very few cases of what seems to be true protective
colouring among them.[1490] In animals, on the contrary, colour is
greatly influenced by their need of protection from, or warning to,
their numerous enemies; colours of other kinds must always, to a
certain extent, be dangerous for the species. Is it probable, then,
that, whilst gay colours occur only in the flowers of those plants to
which they are of real use, conspicuous colours should occur in animals
to which they are of real danger—merely because the females find them
beautiful?

Mr. Wallace, whose well-known criticism of Mr. Darwin’s theory of
sexual selection[1491] seems, in many points, to be conclusive,
suggests that the very frequent superiority of the male bird or insect
in brightness or intensity of colour is due to the greater vigour
and activity and the higher vitality of the male. This intensity of
coloration is therefore most manifest in the male during the breeding
season, when the vitality is at a maximum. It would be further
developed by the combats of the males for the possession of the
females; and the most vigorous and energetic usually leaving the most
numerous and most healthy offspring, natural selection would indirectly
become a preserver and intensifier of colour.[1492] Mr. Wallace has
made it very probable that there is some connection between vigour and
colour, but another question is whether this connection, depending
on some unknown physiological law, is so necessary that it takes
place even when colour is positively disadvantageous to the species.
Nothing of the kind is found in the vegetable kingdom. We know, as Mr.
Wallace himself remarks, that colours which rarely or never appear in
the species in a state of nature, continually occur among cultivated
plants and domesticated animals—a fact which shows that the capacity
to develop colour is ever present.[1493] Among wild plants such colour
variations are never preserved except when they are useful. Is it not
most reasonable to suppose that the like is the case with animals?

The truth seems to be that colour subserves the same purpose in both of
the great kingdoms of the organic world. Just as flowers are coloured
that insects may recognize where honey is to be found, and thus may
be led to promote fertilization, so the sexual colours of animals
have been developed to make it easier for the sexes to find each other
during the pairing time. Protective colours are useful so far as they
conceal the animal from its enemies, but, at the same time, they
conceal it from individuals of its own species. Sexual colours are
therefore useful as well, because they make the animal more visible.
It is quite in accordance with the theory of natural selection that,
where such colours occur, the advantage from them should be greater
than the disadvantage. We can see the reason for the brilliant colours
of humming-birds, as these birds, on account of their great activity
“are practically unmolested,”[1494] and for the bright hues of the
rose chafers, who are saved from attack by a combination of protecting
characters.[1495] But generally there is danger in sexual colours,
so that nature has given them with the utmost cautiousness. Usually
they occur in males only, because of the females’ greater need of
protection.[1496] They are not developed till the age of reproduction,
and they appear, in a great many species, only during the pairing
season. The greatest advantage is won with the least possible peril.

It is a fact of great importance that sexual colours occur exactly
in those species whose habits make these colours most visible. Thus
the nocturnal moths, taken as a body, are much less gaily decorated
than butterflies, all of which are diurnal in their habits, although,
according to Mr. Wallace, the general influence of solar light and heat
is no adequate cause for the variety, intensity, and complexity of the
colours. The females of the ghost moth are yellow with darker markings,
whereas the males are white, that they may be more easily seen by the
females whilst flying about in the dusk; and it is remarkable that,
in the Shetland Islands, the male of this moth, instead of differing
widely from the female, frequently resembles her closely in colour,—as
Mr. Fraser suggests,[1497] because, at the season of the year when
the ghost moth appears in these northern latitudes, the whiteness of
the males is not needed to render them visible to the females in the
twilight night. Both Mr. Darwin[1498] and Mr. Wallace[1499] think that,
in this case, colour may be a means of recognition. Sexual colours
occur chiefly in species which, because of their manner of living, are
to be seen at a distance; they seldom occur in sedentary or slowly
moving terrestrial animals.[1500] The members of the lowly organized
order Thysanura are wingless and dull-coloured. The Hemiptera, which
usually lurk about plants, and prey upon hapless insects, are not,
as a rule, remarkable for conspicuous hues. The Orthoptera are all
terrestrial in their habits, generally feeding upon plants, and,
although some exotic locusts are beautifully ornamented, their bright
tints, according to Mr. Darwin, do not seem to fall under the head of
sexual coloration. On the other hand, the dragon-flies, which live
in the open air, possess splendid green, blue, yellow, and vermilion
metallic tints, and the sexes often differ in their coloration. Every
one has admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies, especially
of the males. Amongst the Fishes, living in a medium through which
bright colours may be observed at a distance, we often find, besides
protective colours, conspicuous hues which are especially intense
and visible during the pairing time. Among the Reptiles, the little
lizards of the genus Draco especially deserve attention; they glide
through the air on their rib-supported parachutes, and the beauty of
their colours baffles description. Mammals, on the other hand, do not
generally present the splendid tints so common among male birds; and
the brighter colours of certain arboreal mammals serve chiefly as means
of concealment.

These phenomena seem to show that sexual colours have been evolved for
the purpose of _being seen_. They can scarcely be due merely to the
fact that coloration is connected with the degree of vitality, since
the Mammals, for instance, are certainly not less vigorous than any
of the other Vertebrate orders. It may perhaps be suggested that,
as flying animals more easily escape their enemies than terrestrial,
they may with less danger be decorated with conspicuous hues. But here
we have to observe the most important fact, that animals which do
not possess sexual colours generally have some other means of making
themselves discoverable.

Flowers which need the help of insects for fertilization attract them,
in some cases, not by bright colours, but by peculiar odours. And as
we do not find conspicuous colours in plants fertilized by the wind,
so flowers have no perfume except where it is of real use. The most
brilliant flowers, as a rule, are those which possess least odour,
whilst many of them have no scent at all. White or very pale flowers
are generally the most odoriferous. M. Mongredien gives a list of about
160 species of hardy trees and shrubs with showy flowers, and another
list of sixty species with fragrant flowers; but only twenty of the
latter are included among the showy species, and these are almost all
white-flowered.[1501] Most of the white flowers are scented only at
night, or their perfumes are most powerfully emitted at that time; the
reason being that white flowers are fertilized chiefly by night-flying
insects. We arrive thus at two conclusions: first, that powerful odours
and conspicuous colours as guides to insect fertilizers are, as a rule,
complementary to each other; secondly, that they occur alternately in
the way most useful to the species.

In the animal kingdom various odours and sounds are closely connected
with the reproduction of the species. During the season of love a
musky odour is emitted by the submaxillary glands of the crocodile,
and pervades its haunts. At the same period the anal scent-glands of
snakes are in active function, and so are the corresponding glands of
the lizards. Many mammals are odoriferous. In some cases the odour
appears to serve as a defence or a protection, but in other species the
glands are confined to the males, and almost always become more active
during the rutting season. Again, a great many insects have the power
of producing stridulous sounds. In two families of the Homoptera and in
three of the Orthoptera, the males alone possess organs of sound in
an efficient state, and these are used incessantly during the pairing
season. Some male fishes have sound-producing instruments, and the
fishermen of Rochelle assert that the males alone make the noise during
the spawning-time. Of frogs and toads the males emit various sounds
at the pairing time, as in the case of the croaking of our common
frog. During the rutting season, and at no other time, the male of
the huge tortoise of the Galapagos Islands utters a hoarse bellowing
noise, which can be heard at a distance of more than a hundred yards.
Professor Aughey states that on two occasions, being himself unseen,
he watched from a little distance a rattle-snake coiled up with head
erect, which continued to rattle at short intervals for half an hour;
at last he saw another snake approach, and when they met they paired.
Among Birds the power of song, or of giving forth strange cries, or
even instrumental music, is exceedingly common, particularly in the
males during the pairing season; and almost all male mammals use their
voices much more during that period than at any other time. Some, as
the giraffe and porcupine, are stated to be completely mute except
during the rutting season.

The colours, odours, and sounds of animals, like the colours and odours
of plants—so far as they may be assumed to be in some way connected
with the reproductive functions—are, as a rule, complementary to each
other. Stridulating insects are generally not conspicuously coloured.
Among the Homoptera, there do not seem to be any well-marked cases
of ornamental differences between the sexes. Among crickets, the
Locustidæ, and grasshoppers, some species are beautifully coloured;
but Mr. Darwin says, “It is not probable that they owe their bright
tints to sexual selection. Conspicuous colours may be of use to these
insects by giving notice that they are unpalatable.” Other species have
directly protective colours. The bright hues of stridulating beetles
seem to be of use chiefly for protective and warning purposes; whereas
species belonging to the orders Neuroptera and Lepidoptera, often
extremely conspicuously coloured, are not remarkable for any stridulous
sounds. Frogs and toads, which have an interesting sexual character
in the musical powers possessed by the males, are evidently coloured
according to the principle of protection, or sometimes tinted with
conspicuous hues in order to be more easily recognized by their enemies
as a nauseous food. Of Reptiles, the Lacertilia excel mainly in bright
tints; the Chelonia, Crocodilia, and Ophidia, in sounds and odours.
Among Birds, in one instance at least, the male is remarkable for his
scent. “During the pairing and breeding season,” says Mr. Gould, with
reference to the Australian musk-duck, “ ... this bird emits a strong
musky odour;” it is not ornamented with any conspicuous hues.[1502]
Sexual colours and the power of song are generally complementary to
each other among Birds. “As a general rule,” Mr. Wood remarks, “it
is found that the most brilliant songsters among the birds are attired
in the plainest garb; and it may safely be predicted of any peculiarly
gorgeous bird, that power, quality and sweetness of voice are in
inverse ratio to its beauty of plumage.”[1503] Thus, of the British
birds, with the exception of the bullfinch and goldfinch, the best
songsters are plain-coloured, and the brilliant birds of the tropics
are hardly ever songsters. The wild camel in the desert of Kum-tagh has
a reddish, sandy hue, and the males, “even during the rutting season,
utter no sound, but find their consorts by scent.”[1504] The musk-deer,
well known for the intolerable perfume which the males emit at the
pairing time, is also entirely silent.[1505]

Moreover, as appears from what has just been said, the sexual colours,
the perceptible scents and sounds of animals are complementary to
each other in the way that is best suited to make the animals easily
discoverable. As bright colours would be of no advantage to flowers
fertilized by night-flying insects, so they would be of comparatively
little advantage to animals living among grass and plants, in woods
and bushes; whereas sounds and scents make the animal recognizable at
a considerable distance. We have also seen that it is among flying and
aquatic animals that sexual colours chiefly occur, whereas terrestrial
animals excel in sound and scents. Thus most of the stridulating
insects are terrestrial. Whilst brightly-coloured lizards, living on
trees or running from stone to stone, must attract attention by the
brilliance of their covering, crocodiles inhabiting rivers and jungles,
and frogs crawling among the grass, allure their mates, the former by
emitting musky odours, the latter by producing loud sounds. The odour
of the Australian musk-duck, which depends for its food and for its
preservation from danger upon its powers of diving rather than upon
those of flying, is, as Mr. Gould observes, often perceptible long
before the animal can be seen.[1506]

Mr. Darwin remarks, as regards birds, “Bright colours and the power of
song seem to replace each other. We can perceive that, if the plumage
did not vary in brightness, or if bright colours were dangerous to
the species, other means would be employed to charm the females; and
melody of voice offers one such means.”[1507] But if we accept Mr.
Darwin’s theory of sexual selection, we are compelled to suppose that
that inexplicable æsthetic sense of the females has been developed in
the way most dangerous to the species. Conspicuous colours are admired
by the females of those animals which, by means of such colours, are
most easily discovered by their enemies, and sounds and odours are
appreciated exactly in those species to which they are most perilous.
If, on the contrary, we accept the explanation that, although sexual
colours, odours, and sounds are in some ways hurtful to the species,
they are upon the whole advantageous, inasmuch as they make it easier
for the sexes to find each other, we have a theory in accordance
with all known facts, as well as with the great principle of natural
selection. It may be objected that it is not the females but the
males that are the seekers, whilst the secondary sexual characters
generally occur in the males only. But we have no reason to think
that the females are entirely passive during the pairing season; and
several of the statements collected by Mr. Darwin directly indicate
that females are attracted by the sounds of their future partners. If
Burdach is correct in saying that the male sex generally possesses
more acute senses than the female,[1508] it is obvious that secondary
sexual characters would be of less use to females than to males, as it
certainly would be of greater danger.

In his work on ‘Darwinism,’ Mr. Wallace expresses the opinion that
the various sounds and odours which are peculiar to the male serve
as a call to the female, or as an indication of his presence; and,
as he says, “the production, intensification, and differentiation
of these sounds and odours are clearly within the power of natural
selection.”[1509] Mr. Wallace has also shown the immense importance of
colour as a means of recognition. The theory here set forth thus, in
fact, very nearly approaches his views. The only difference is that
the sexual colours have been classified under the head of “colour
for recognition,” though the positive cause by which they have been
produced may be a surplus of vital energy.

We have still to consider certain secondary sexual characters which,
according to Mr. Darwin, must be regarded as ornaments. With these he
classes the great horns which rise from the head, thorax, and clypeus
of many male beetles; the appendages with which some male fishes and
reptiles are provided; the combs, plumes, crests, and protuberances
of many male birds; and various crests, tufts, and mantles of hair
which are found in certain mammals. But some of these characters may
be of use to the males in their fights for females, or serve as means
of recognition. Mr. Wallace suggests that crests and other erectile
feathers may have been useful in making the bird more formidable in
appearance, and in thus frightening away enemies; while long tail or
wing feathers might serve to distract the aim of a bird of prey.[1510]
Moreover, characters of which we cannot yet perceive the use may in
the future be brought under the law of utility, as has been the case
in so many other instances. According to Mr. Wallace, the ornamental
appendages of birds and other animals are due to a surplus of vital
energy, leading to abnormal growths in those parts of the integument
where muscular and nervous action are greatest.[1511] And where these
“ornaments” are of no positive disadvantage to the species, certainly
no other explanation is needed.

For other arguments which may be advanced against Mr. Darwin’s
theory of sexual selection, reference may be made to Mr. Wallace’s
criticisms in ‘Tropical Nature’ and ‘Darwinism.’ We have sufficient
evidence that females are pleased or excited by the males’ display of
their sexual colours,[1512] and are charmed by their songs. But Mr.
Darwin’s theory presupposes, amongst many other things, that almost
all the females of a species, over a wide area and for many successive
generations, prefer exactly the same modification of the colour, or
ornament or sounds.[1513] Moreover, if the secondary sexual characters
are due to female choice, how shall we explain the strange fact that
the taste of the females varies so much that there are scarcely two
species in which the standard of perfection is exactly the same? This
difficulty did not escape Mr. Darwin. “It is a curious fact,” he says,
“that in the same class of animals sounds so different as the drumming
of the snipe’s tail, the tapping of the woodpecker’s beak, the harsh
trumpet-like cry of certain waterfowl, the cooing of the turtle-dove,
and the song of the nightingale, should all be pleasing to the females
of the several species.” And further, “What shall we say about the
harsh screams of, for instance, some kinds of macaws; have these birds
as bad taste for musical sounds as they apparently have for colour,
judging by the inharmonious contrast of their bright yellow and blue
plumage?”[1514]

The theory now suggested accounts fully for this difference in taste.
The immense variability of the secondary sexual characters is
precisely what might be expected, if their object is to make it easier
for the sexes to find and recognize each other. And it is natural that
the females should be pleased by colours, odours, or sounds which, by
the association of ideas, are to them the symbols of the most exciting
period of their lives. On the other hand, we know that differently
coloured races of the same species may be disinclined to pair
together.[1515] And here, I think, we may draw an important conclusion.
The great stability of the secondary sexual characters which we find in
wild species, but certainly not in animals under domestication, seems
to be due chiefly to the fact that those males which most typically
represent the peculiarities of their species have the best chance of
finding mates.

The reader may have felt some surprise at this strange jump from the
_patria potestas_ to a discussion of merely zoological facts, which
have nothing to do, directly, with the history of human marriage. But
we have now to deal with the sexual selection of man, and, for the
right understanding of this, it was necessary to show that the sexual
selection of the lower animals is entirely subordinate to the great law
of natural selection. Mr. Darwin discussed the origin of the secondary
sexual characters as a preliminary to the statement of his theory
regarding the origin of man, and of the different races of men. At the
end of the next chapter we shall consider whether this theory appears
to be in accordance with facts or not.




CHAPTER XII

THE SEXUAL SELECTION OF MAN: TYPICAL BEAUTY


By the “Sexual Selection of Man” is meant the choice made by men
and women as regards relations with the opposite sex. Mr. Darwin has
shown that such selection takes place among the lower Vertebrata, and,
judging from what we know of domesticated animals, it is much more
common in the case of females than in that of males. The male, indeed,
as a rule, seems to be ready to pair with any female, provided she
belongs to his own species.[1516] As this probably depends upon the
great strength of his sexual impulse, we may infer that in primitive
times, when man had a definite pairing season, he displayed a like
tendency, and that the sexual instinct, in proportion as it has become
less intense, has become more discriminating.

Even now woman is more particular in her choice than man, provided
that the union takes place without reference to interest. A Maori
proverb says, “Let a man be ever so good-looking, he will not be much
sought after; but let a woman be ever so plain, men will still eagerly
seek after her.”[1517] With regard to the Negroes of Sogno, Merolla
da Sorrento states, “Women would have experience of their husbands
before they married them, in like manner as the men were to have of
them; and in this particular I can aver that they are commonly much
more obstinate or fickle than men, for I have known many instances in
which the men were willing to be married, while the women held back,
and either fled away or made excuses.”[1518] Among the Eastern Central
Africans, according to Mr. Macdonald, many cases are known of slave
wives running away from free husbands, but none of slave husbands
running away from free wives.[1519] In the crossings between unequal
human races, the father almost always belongs to the superior race.
“In every case,” says M. de Quatrefages, “and especially in transient
amours, woman refuses to lower herself; man is less delicate.”[1520]
Thus, cases in which negresses form unions with the indigenous men of
America are very rare;[1521] and Dr. Nott, who wrote in the middle of
this century, never personally met any one who was the offspring of
a negro man and a white woman, because of the extreme rarity of such
half-breeds.[1522] In New Zealand it sometimes happens that a European
man marries a Maori woman; but Mr. Kerry Nicholls never came across an
instance where a European woman had married a Maori man.[1523] Even in
civilized society men are less particular in their connections than
women of corresponding education, no doubt, would be, even if the rules
of everyday morality were the same for both sexes.

       *       *       *       *       *

In this and the following four chapters we shall deal with the
instinctive feelings by which the sexes are guided in the act of
selection. We have already observed that the sexual instinct is excited
by artificial means, such as ornaments, mutilations, &c. Now we have
to consider the intrinsic characters of a human being which affect the
passions of a person of the opposite sex.

Mr. Darwin has shown that, among the lower Vertebrata, the female
commonly gives the preference to “the most vigorous, defiant, and
mettlesome male,”—a taste the origin of which is easily accounted for
by the theory of natural selection. A similar instinctive appreciation
of manly strength and courage is found in women, especially in the
women of savage races. In a song, communicated by Mr. Schoolcraft,
an Indian girl gives the following description of her ideal:— “My
love is tall and graceful as the young pine waving on the hill—And as
swift in his course as the noble stately deer—His hair is flowing,
and dark as the blackbird that floats through the air—And his eyes,
like the eagle’s, both piercing and bright—His heart, it is fearless
and great—And his arm, it is strong in the fight.”[1524] A tale from
Madagascar tells of a princess whose beauty fascinated all men.
Many princes fought to obtain possession of her; but she refused
them all, and chose a lover who was young, handsome, courageous,
and strong.[1525] The beautiful Atalanta gave herself to the best
runner;[1526] and the hero suitors of the Finnish myths had to undergo
difficult trials to prove their courage.[1527] “When a Dyak wants to
marry,” says Mr. Bock, “he must show himself a hero before he can
gain favour with his intended.” He has to secure a number of human
heads by killing men of hostile tribes; and the more heads he cuts off,
the greater the pride and admiration with which he is regarded by his
bride.[1528] The demands of the Sàkalàva girls of Madagascar are less
cruel. When a young man wishes to obtain a wife, his qualifications,
according to Mr. Sibree, are tested thus:—“Placed at a certain
distance from a clever caster of the spear, he is bidden to catch
between his arm and side every spear thrown by the man opposite to him.
If he displays fear or fails to catch the spear, he is ignominiously
rejected; but if there be no flinching and the spears are caught, he
is at once proclaimed an accepted ‘lover.’” It is said that a similar
custom prevailed among the Bétsiléo, another Madagascar tribe.[1529]
Among the Dongolowees, as we are informed by Dr. Felkin, if two men are
suitors for a girl, and there is a difficulty in deciding between the
rivals, the following method is adopted. The fair lady has a knife tied
to each forearm, so fixed that the blade of the knife projects below
the elbow. She then takes up a position on a log of wood, the young
men sitting on either side with their legs closely pressed against
hers. Raising her arms, the girl leans forward, and slowly presses the
knives into the thighs of her would-be husbands. The suitor who best
undergoes this trial of endurance wins the bride, whose first duty
after marriage is to dress the wounds she has herself inflicted.[1530]
Speaking of the natives on the River Darling, Major T. L. Mitchell
says that the possession of gins, or wives, appears to be associated
with all their ideas of fighting; “while, on the other hand, the gins
have it in their power on such occasions to evince that universal
characteristic of the fair, a partiality for the brave. Thus it is,
that, after a battle, they do not always follow their fugitive husbands
from the field, but frequently go over as a matter of course, to the
victors.”[1531]

We may infer that women’s instinctive inclination to strong and
courageous men is due to natural selection in two ways. A strong man
is not only father of strong children, but he is also better able than
a weak man to protect his offspring. The female instinct is especially
well marked at the lower stages of civilization, because bodily vigour
is then of most importance in the struggle for existence. The same
principle explains the attraction which health in a woman has for men.
In civilized society, infirmity and sickliness are not always a serious
hindrance to love, but in a savage state, says Alexander v. Humboldt,
“nothing can induce a man to unite himself to a deformed woman, or one
who is very unhealthy.”[1532]

The ancient Greeks conceived Eros as an extremely handsome youth, and
Aphrodite was the goddess of beauty as well as of love. So closely
are these two ideas—love and beauty—connected. This connection is not
peculiar to the civilized mind. In Tahiti, Cook saw several instances
where women preferred personal beauty to interest.[1533] The Negroes of
the West African Coast, according to Mr. Winwood Reade, often discuss
the beauty of their women;[1534] and, among the cannibal savages of
Northern Queensland, described by Herr Lumholtz, the women take much
notice of a man’s face, especially of the part about the eyes.[1535]
But, although in every country, in every race, beauty stimulates
passion, the ideas of what constitutes beauty vary indefinitely. As
Hume says, “Beauty is no quality in things themselves; it exists
merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a
different beauty.”[1536]

A flat, retreating brow seems to white men to spoil what would
otherwise be a pretty face; but “the Chinook ideal of facial beauty,”
says Mr. Bancroft, “is a straight line from the end of the nose to the
crown of the head.”[1537] A little snubnose may embitter the life of a
European girl; but the Australian natives “laugh at the sharp noses
of Europeans, and call them in their language ‘tomahawk noses,’ much
preferring their own style of flat broad noses.”[1538] The Tahitians
frequently said to Mr. Williams, “What a pity it is that English
mothers pull the children’s noses so much, and make them so frightfully
long!”[1539] We admire white teeth and rosy cheeks; but a servant
of the king of Cochin China spoke with contempt of the wife of the
English ambassador, because she had white teeth like a dog and a rosy
colour like that of potato flowers.[1540] In the northern parts of the
Chinese Empire, according to Pallas, those women are preferred who are
of the Manchu type,—that is, who have a broad face, high cheek-bones,
very broad noses, and enormous ears;[1541] and the South American
Uaupés consider a swollen calf one of the chief attractions a young
lady can possess, the result being that girls wear a tight garter below
the knee from infancy.[1542]

Even among the Aryan peoples the standard of beauty varies. “To an
honest Fleming, who has never studied design,” says M. Bombet, “the
forms of Rubens’s women are the most beautiful in the world. Let not
us, who admire slenderness of form above everything else, and to whom
the figures even of Raphael’s women appear rather massive, be too ready
to laugh at him. If we were to consider the matter closely, it would
appear that each individual, and, consequently, each nation, has a
separate idea of beauty.”[1543]

What human characteristics are considered beautiful, and how has
beauty come to influence the sexual selection of man? In trying to
answer these questions, we shall note only such characteristics as
are held to be beautiful by considerable groups of men, apart from
individual differences of taste; and we shall confine ourselves to
physical beauty, as presenting itself in bodily forms and the colour
of the skin. Mr. Spencer maintains that “mental and facial perfection
are fundamentally connected,” and that “the aspects which please
us are the outward correlatives of inward perfections, while the
aspects which displease us are the outward correlatives of inward
imperfections.”[1544] But Mr. Spencer evidently looks upon beauty, or
“facial perfection,” as something real in the sense in which mental
qualities are real,—an opinion with which it is difficult to agree.
The lateral jutting-out of the cheek-bones, which seems to him an index
of imperfection, is admired by many of the lower races.

The full development of those visible properties which are essential
to the human organism is universally recognized as indispensable to
perfect beauty,—natural deformity, the unsymmetrical shape of the
body, apparent traces of disease, &c., being regarded by every race as
unfavourable to personal appearance. We distinguish between masculine
and feminine beauty, and, in spite of racial differences, the ideas
of what constitute these forms of beauty are fundamentally the same
throughout the world. To be really handsome a person must approach
the ideal type of his or her sex. The male organism is remarkable for
the development of the muscular system, the female for that of fatty
elements; and conspicuous muscles are everywhere considered to improve
the appearance of a man, rounded forms that of a woman. According to v.
Humboldt, the natives of Guiana, to express the beauty of a woman, say
that “she is fat and has a narrow forehead.” A traveller found that
a Kirghiz’s estimate of female beauty was regulated by the amount of
fat, “for even when dilating on the beauties of his favourite wife,
he laid the greatest stress on her _embonpoint_.”[1545] The Kafirs
and Hottentots are charmed by their women’s long and pendant breasts,
which, in certain tribes, assume such monstrous dimensions, that the
usual way of giving suck, when the child is carried on the back, is
by throwing the breast over the shoulder.[1546] Mr. Reade tells us
that, among the Mpongwé of Gaboon, even very young girls “strive to
emulate the pendant beauties of their seniors.”[1547] The Makololo
women, according to Dr. Livingstone, make themselves fat and pretty
by drinking a peculiar drink called “boyáloa”;[1548] and, among the
Trarsa, a Moorish tribe in the Western Sahara, the women take immense
quantities of milk and butter to make themselves more attractive.[1549]
Such exaggerations, however repugnant to a more refined taste,
indicate a general tendency in men’s notions of female beauty.

Among Europeans, men are on an average two or three inches taller than
women,[1550] and have a greater breadth of shoulder. A high-built
and broad-shouldered figure is also regarded as an ideal of manly
beauty, whereas women who are very tall or broad are apt to be rather
awkward. A woman’s face is shorter, her mouth less broad, her nose less
prominent, her neck longer, her pelvis wider, her waist narrower than
a man’s; and her fingers are more slender and pointed, her hands and
feet smaller. The halving line of a woman’s body is lower than that of
a man’s, so that her steps are shorter and lighter.[1551] As a matter
of fact, a long face, a broad mouth, and large hands and feet are much
more objectionable in a woman than in a man. Women have a special
liking for low-bodied dresses, which display the full length of the
neck; and by means of a corset they make the waist narrower than it is
by nature.

There is thus an ideal of beauty which, no doubt, may be said to be
common to the whole human race. But this ideal is merely an abstraction
which can never be realized. General similarities in taste are
accompanied by specific differences. Though every one admits that
a face without a nose is ugly, no particular form of the nose is
universally admired; and races which regard a swelling bosom as essen—
tial to feminine beauty differ widely from the Hottentots as to the
charm of pendant breasts.

Every race has, indeed, its own standard of beauty. Alexander von
Humboldt long ago observed, “Nations attach the idea of beauty
to everything which particularly characterizes their own physical
conformation, their natural physiognomy. Thence it results that,
if nature have bestowed very little beard, a narrow forehead, or
a brownish-red skin, every individual thinks himself beautiful in
proportion as his body is destitute of hair, his head flattened,
his skin more covered with ‘annotto,’ or ‘chica,’ or some other
coppery-red colour.”[1552] This view has been adopted by several later
writers,[1553] but, as it has been disputed by others,[1554] it may
be well to bring together some fresh evidence, as an addition to that
collected by Mr. Darwin.

The Sinhalese, says Dr. Davy, who are great connoisseurs of the charms
of the sex, and have books on the subject, and rules to aid the
judgment, would not allow a woman to be perfectly beautiful unless she
had the following characteristics:—“Her hair should be voluminous like
the tail of the peacock, long, reaching to the knees, and terminating
in graceful curls; her nose should be like the bill of the hawk, and
lips bright and red, like coral on the young leaf of the iron-tree.
Her neck should be large and round, her chest capacious, her breasts
firm and conical, like the yellow cocoa-nut, and her waist small—almost
small enough to be clasped by the hand. Her lips should be wide; her
limbs tapering; the soles of her feet without any hollow, and the
surface of her body in general, soft, delicate, smooth, and rounded,
without the asperities of projecting bones and sinews.” Dr. Davy adds,
“The preceding is the most general external character that can be
given of the Sinhalese.”[1555]

The women of the Indo-European race are remarkable for the length of
their hair. “Dans nos contrées,” Isidore Geoffroy observes, “ces
développements ajoutent à la beauté des femmes; dans d’autres pays,
si on les y observait, ils passeraient presque pour de légers vices
de conformation.”[1556] “A small round face,” says Castrén, “full
rosy red cheeks and lips, white forehead, black tresses, and small
dark eyes are marks of a Samoyede beauty. Thus in a Samoyedian song
a girl is praised for her small eyes, her broad face, and its rosy
colour.”[1557] These, as we know, are the typical characteristics of
the Samoyedes.[1558] As to the Tartar women, who generally have far
less prominent noses than we in Europe are accustomed to see, Father
de Rubruquis states, “The less their noses the handsomer they are
esteemed.”[1559] In Fiji, the remarkably broad occiput, peculiar
to its people, is looked upon as a mark of beauty.[1560] Among the
Egyptians Mr. Lane scarcely ever saw corpulent persons, and, unlike
many other African peoples, they do not admire very fat women:—“In
his love-songs, the Egyptian commonly describes the object of his
affections as of slender figure, and small waist.”[1561] “The
negroes,” says v. Humboldt, “give the preference to the thickest and
most prominent lips; the Kalmucks to turned-up noses; and the Greeks,
in the statues of heroes, raised the facial line from 85° to 100°
beyond nature. The Aztecs, who never disfigure the heads of their
children, represent their principal divinities, as their hieroglyphical
manuscripts prove, with a head much more flattened than any I have ever
seen among the Caribs.”[1562]

The fashion, prevalent among many peoples, of transforming parts of
the body, affords a good illustration of their ideas about personal
beauty. The Indians of North America, who have a low and flat forehead,
often exaggerate this natural peculiarity by an artificial flattening
of the forehead.[1563] In Tahiti, Samoa, and other islands of the
Pacific Ocean, it has been customary from time immemorial to flatten
the occiputs and to press the noses of the infants, as Professor
Gerland observes, in order to increase a national characteristic which
is considered beautiful.[1564] The same practice occurs in Sumatra,
and Marsden could learn no other reason for it, but that it was an
improvement of beauty in the estimation of the natives.[1565] Among
the Ovambo of South Africa, the fashion is quite different:—“With
the exception of the crown, which is always left untouched,” says
Andersson, “the men often shave the head, which has the effect of
magnifying the natural prominence of the hinder parts of it.”[1566]
Among the Chinese, small feet are considered a woman’s chief
attraction; hence the feet of girls are pressed from early childhood.
Now we know from the measurements made by Scherzer and Schwarz, that
Chinese women have by nature unusually small feet—a peculiarity which
has always distinguished them from their Tartar neighbours. And, as a
matter of fact, the Manchu Tartars, who at present rule the Chinese
Empire, never press the feet of their daughters.[1567]

Each race considers its own colour preferable to every other. The
North American Indians admire “a tawny hide,” and the Chinese dislike
the white skin of the Europeans.[1568] Some young New Zealanders, who
themselves were lightly copper-coloured, were greatly amused at the
dark tint of an Australian, and laughed at him for being so ugly.[1569]
Barrington tells us on the other hand, of an Australian woman, who,
having had a child by a white man, smoked it and rubbed it with oil to
give it a darker colour.[1570] The Hovas, who are probably, as a rule,
the lightest people in Madagascar, often put a spot of dark colour on
the cheeks, in order to heighten the effect of their fair complexion,
of which they are very proud.[1571] Among the Malays, according to Mr.
Crawfurd, “the standard of perfection in colour is virgin gold, and,
as a European lover compares the bosom of his mistress to the whiteness
of snow, the East Insular lover compares that of his to the yellowness
of the precious metal.”[1572]

The object of the painting of the body, so commonly practised among
savages, seems sometimes to be to exaggerate the natural colour of the
skin. Von Humboldt believes that this is the reason why the American
Indians paint themselves with red ochre and earth.[1573] The natives
of Tana, who have the colour of an old copper coin, usually dye their
bodies a few shades darker;[1574] whilst the Bornabi Islanders, who
have a light copper-coloured complexion, “anoint their bodies with
turmeric, in order to give themselves a whiter appearance.”[1575]
The Javanese, when in full dress, smear themselves with a yellow
cosmetic.[1576] And, speaking of the people of a place in Maabar
(Coromandel Coast), Marco Polo says, “The children that are born here
are black enough, but the blacker they be the more they are thought
of; wherefore from the day of their birth their parents do rub them
every week with oil of sesamé, so that they become as black as devils.
Moreover, they make their gods black and their devils white, and the
images of their saints they do paint black all over.”[1577]

The question,—What characteristics of the human form are deemed
beautiful? may now be answered. Men find beauty in the full development
of the visible characteristics belonging to the human organism in
general; of those peculiar to the sex; of those peculiar to the race.
We have next to consider the connection of love and beauty.

That this connection does not depend upon the æsthetic pleasure excited
by beauty is obvious from the fact that the intrinsic character of
an æsthetic feeling is disinterestedness, whereas the intrinsic
character of love is the very reverse. So far as beauty implies the
full development of characteristics essential to the human organism,
or to either of the sexes, the preference given to it follows from the
instinctive inclination to healthiness, already mentioned, and needs
no further discussion. The question is to explain the stimulating
influence of racial perfection.

“In barbarous nations,” says v. Humboldt, “there is a physiognomy
peculiar to the tribe or horde rather than to any individual. When we
compare our domestic animals with those which inhabit our forests, we
make the same observation.”[1578] The accuracy of this statement has
been confirmed by later writers;[1579] and we may say with M. Godron,
“C’est —aujourd’hui un fait parfaitement acquis à la science, que plus
un peuple se rapproche de l’état de nature, plus les hommes qui le
composent se ressemblent entre eux.”[1580] This likeness does not refer
to the physiognomy only, but to the body as a whole. The variations of
stature, for instance, are known to be least considerable among the
peoples least advanced in civilization.[1581]

It cannot be doubted that this greater similarity is due partly to
the greater uniformity of the conditions of life to which uncivilized
peoples are subject. According to Villermé and Quetelet, an inequality
of stature is observed not only between the inhabitants of towns on
the one hand and those of the country on the other, but also, in the
interior of towns, between individuals of different professions.[1582]
There is, however, another factor, which is, I think, of still greater
importance.

The deviations from the national type, which occur sporadically, have
been considered the result of disease, and can, as Professor Waitz
observes, “but rarely become permanent, as the national type is
always that which harmonizes with the soil and the climate, and the
external relations in which the respective peoples live.”[1583] We must
assume that a certain kind of constitution is best suited for certain
conditions of life, and that every considerable deviation from this
must perish in the struggle for existence in a state in which natural
selection is constantly at work and physical qualities are of the
first importance. We know from Isidore Geoffroy’s investigations that
persons who deviate much, with regard to the length of body, from the
common standard—they may be dwarfs or giants—are, as a rule, abnormal
in other respects also, being deficient in intelligence as well as in
the power of reproduction, and being especially liable to premature
death.[1584] Sir W. Lawrence, too, remarks that the strength of men
who have considerably exceeded the ordinary standard has by no means
corresponded to their size, and that “there are very few instances of
what we can deem healthy, well-made men, with all the proper attributes
of the race, much below the general standard.”[1585] If, among
civilized peoples, such deviations indicate some disturbance of the
vital functions, and, as a consequence, are unfavourable to existence,
this must be even more the case with savage tribes, all the members
of which are subject to nearly the same conditions of life. Abnormal
characteristics may sometimes flourish in a highly civilized society,
but they are doomed to perish in communities among whom the struggle
for existence is far more severe.

It may at first sight seem strange that all the characteristics,
however slight, in which the various races of men differ from each
other, should harmonize with particular conditions of life to the
exclusion of others. But it must be remembered that, if we had fuller
knowledge, characteristics which seem to us useless, or even hurtful,
might be seen to be useful. We know the utility of _some_ special
characteristics, and that of others may, at least provisionally,
be assumed. It is certain that the physiological functions of most
persons who quit their native land and settle in a wholly different
region, must undergo a considerable change if the new conditions are
not to have injurious effects. Moreover, many bodily structures are so
intimately related, that when one part varies others vary also, though,
in most instances, we are quite unable to assign any reason why this
should be the case.

Savage men are generally distinguished for relatively large jaws,
which, no doubt, are of use in a state of nature, where food is often
hard and tough, where the jaws have to perform the functions of knife
and fork, and where the teeth occasionally serve as implements. This
racial peculiarity, being in fact only a mark of low civilization, is
thus easily accounted for by the law of natural selection. The less
man, with advancing civilization, was in want of large and strong jaws,
the greater was the chance for individuals born with smaller jaws to
survive; hence a race with comparatively small jaws gradually arose.
Indeed, Professor Virchow has shown that the prognathous type of face
is inconsistent with the full development of the brain.[1586]

Another peculiarity which characterizes the lower races of men is the
lateral jutting-out of the cheek-bones. But, as Mr. Spencer observes,
this excessive size of the cheek-bones is only an accompaniment of
large jaws. Other peculiarities of feature—depression of the bridge of
the nose, forward opening of the nostrils, wide-spread _alæ_, and a
long and large mouth—constantly coexist with large and protuberant jaws
and great cheek-bones, alike in uncivilized races and in the young of
civilized races;[1587] hence we cannot believe that the connection is
merely accidental.

Professor Schaaffhausen has noticed that many peculiarities of the
skull are coincident with arrested cerebral development and correlated
to each other:—“The characters observed in the skulls of the lower
races, namely, a narrow and low frontal bone, a short sagittal
suture, a low temporal squama, a short occipital squama, the upper
margin of which forms a flat arch, are therefore to be considered
as approximations to the animal form, and they stand to each other
in organic connection.”[1588] It seems as if stature and muscular
force were in some way connected with the dolichocephalic and the
brachycephalic forms of the skull, for Welcker found that short men and
short races incline more to the latter, tall men and tall races to the
former. Again, according to Fick, the muscles exercise a remarkable
influence on the form of the bones in general, and particularly upon
some cranial bones.[1589]

The process of acclimatization affords opportunities for the study of
the connection between organic structures and functions on the one
hand, and surrounding nature on the other. At present, however, our
knowledge of the subject is exceedingly scanty. It has been asserted
that the curly hair of the European becomes straight in America,—like
the hair of an Indian; that in North America, as in New South Wales,
children of European parents are apt to become tall and lean, whilst
there is a tendency among European colonists at the Cape to grow
fat,—which reminds us of the steatopygy of the native women.[1590]
Almost all that we know with certainty is that, in the process of
acclimatization, man has to undergo a change, and that this change is
often too great to be endurable. As Dr. Felkin observes, Europeans are
almost incapable of forming colonies in the tropics;[1591] and, with
few exceptions, they have been unable to rear a sound progeny there
in marriage with white women.[1592] Colonel Hadden, who has spent
sixteen years in India, informs me that it is a prevalent opinion
among British officers in that country that an English regiment of a
thousand men would, within thirteen years, from climate, disease, or
other casualties, almost w
