luable presents were given for a girl who had preserved her virtue,
the bride’s purity being proved in a way that will not bear the light
of description.[678]

“In many parts of Africa,” says Mr. Reade, “no marriage can be
ratified till a jury of matrons have pronounced a verdict of purity
on the bride;[679] it being customary to return a girl who is found
not to have been entirely chaste, and to claim back the price paid
for her.[680] Dr. Grade states that among the Negroes of Togoland, a
much higher price is paid for a bride who is a virgin than for any
other.[681] Among the Somals, a fallen girl cannot become a man’s
legitimate wife;[682] whilst, in the Soudan and other parts of Africa
where girls are subjected to infibulation, that incontinence may be
made impossible, no young woman who is not infibulated can get a
husband.[683]

The Jewish custom of handing “the tokens of the damsel’s virginity”
to her parents, to be kept as evidence in case of a later accusation,
is well-known.[684] A practice not very dissimilar to this prevails in
China,[685] Arabia,[686] and among the Chuvashes,[687] with whom the
_signum innocentiae_ is exhibited even _coram populo_. In Persia,[688]
as also in Circassia,[689] a girl who is not a virgin when she marries,
runs the risk of being put away after the first night. Among several
nations belonging to the Russian Empire, according to Georgi, the
bridegroom may claim a fine in case of the bride being found to have
lost her virtue;[690] and, among the Chulims, if the Mosaic testimony
of chastity is wanting, the husband goes away and does not return
before the seducer has made peace with him.[691] As to the ancient
Germans, Tacitus states that, by their laws, virgins only could
marry.[692]

A husband’s pretensions may reach even farther than this. He often
demands that the woman he chooses for his wife shall belong to him, not
during his lifetime only, but after his death.

The belief in another life is almost universal in the human race. As
that life is supposed to resemble this, man having the same necessities
there as here, part of his property is buried with him. And so strong
is the idea of a wife being the exclusive property of her husband,
that, among several peoples, she may not even survive him.

Thus, formerly, among the Comanches, when a man died, his favourite
wife was killed at the same time.[693] In certain Californian tribes,
widows were sacrificed on the pyre with their deceased husbands;[694]
and Mackenzie was told that this practice sometimes occurred among
the Crees.[695] In Darien and Panama, on the death of a chief, all
his concubines were interred with him.[696] When one of the Incas
died, says Acosta, the woman whom he had loved best, as well as his
servants and officers, were put to death, “that they might serve him
in the other life.”[697] The same custom prevailed in the region of the
Congo, as also in some other African countries.[698] “It is no longer
possible to doubt,” says Dr. Schrader, “that ancient Indo-Germanic
custom ordained that the wife should die with her husband.”[699] In
India, as is well known, widows were sacrificed, until quite recently,
on the funeral pile of their husbands;[700] whilst, among the Tartars,
according to Navarette, on a man’s death, one of his wives hanged
herself “to bear him company in that journey.” Among the Chinese,
something of the same kind seems to have been done occasionally in
olden times.[701]

Turning to other quarters of the world: in Polynesia, and especially
in Melanesia, widows were very commonly killed.[702] In Fiji, for
instance, they were either buried alive or strangled, often at their
own desire, because they believed that in this way alone could they
reach the realms of bliss, and that she who met her death with the
greatest devotedness, would become the favourite wife in the abode
of spirits. On the other hand, a widow who did not permit herself to
be killed was considered an adulteress.[703] In the New Hebrides,
according to the missionary John Inglis, a wife is strangled, even when
her husband is long absent from home.[704]

If the husband’s demands are less severe, his widow is not on that
account always exempted from every duty towards him after his death.
Among the Tacullies, she is compelled by the kinsfolk of the deceased
to lie on the funeral pile where the body of her husband is placed,
whilst the fire is lighting, until the heat becomes unbearable. Then,
after the body is consumed, she is obliged to collect the ashes and
deposit them in a small basket, which she must always carry about
with her for two or three years, during which time she is not at
liberty to marry again.[705] Among the Kutchin Indians, the widow, or
widows, are bound to remain near the body for a year to protect it
from animals, &c.; and only when it is quite decayed and merely the
bones remain, are they permitted to remarry, “to dress their hair,
and put on beads and other ornaments to attract admirers.”[706] Again,
among the Minas on the Slave Coast, the widows are shut up for six
months in the room where their husband is buried.[707] With the Kukis,
according to Rennel, a widow was compelled to remain for a year beside
the tomb of her deceased husband, her family bringing her food.[708]
In the Mosquito tribe, “the widow was bound to supply the grave of
her husband with provisions for a year, after which she took up the
bones and carried them with her for another year, at last placing them
upon the roof of her house, and then only was she allowed to marry
again.”[709]

In Rotuma and the Marquesas Islands,[710] as well as among the Tartars
and Iroquois,[711] a widow was never allowed to enter a second time
into the married state. Among the ancient Peruvians, says Garcilasso
de la Vega, very few widows who had no children ever married again,
and even widows who had children continued to live single; “for this
virtue was much commended in their laws and ordinances.”[712] Nor is it
in China considered proper for a widow to contract a second marriage,
and in genteel families such an event rarely, if ever, occurs. Indeed,
a lady of rank, by contracting a second marriage, exposes herself
to a penalty of eighty blows.[713] Again, the Arabs, according to
Burckhardt, regard everything connected with the nuptials of a widow
as ill-omened, and unworthy of the participation of generous and
honourable men.[714]

Speaking of the Aryans, Dr. Schrader remarks that, when sentiments
had become more humane, traces of the old state of things survived in
the prohibitions issued against the second marriage of widows.[715]
Even now, according to Dubois, the happiest lot that can befall a
Hindu woman, particularly one of the Brahman caste, is to die in the
married state. The bare mention of a second marriage for her would be
considered the greatest of insults, and, if she married again, “she
would be hunted out of society, and no decent person would venture at
any time to have the slightest intercourse with her.”[716] Again, among
the Bhills, when a widow marries, the newly-wedded pair, according
to a long-established custom, are obliged to leave the house before
daybreak and pass the next day in the fields, in a solitary place,
some miles from the village, nor may they return till the dusk. The
necessity of the couple passing the first day of their marriage in
this way, like outcasts, is, writes Sir J. Malcolm, “to mark that
sense of degradation which all the natives of Hindustan entertain
against a woman marrying a second husband.”[717] The South Slavonians,
says Krauss, regard a widow’s remarriage as an insult to her former
consort;[718] and a similar view prevailed in ancient Greece, according
to Pausanias,[719] and among the Romans.[720] The early Christians,
also, strongly disapproved of second marriages by persons of either
sex, although St. Paul had peremptorily urged that the younger widows
should marry.[721] Indeed the practice of second nuptials was branded
with the name of a legal adultery, and the persons who were guilty of
so scandalous an offence against Christian purity were soon excluded
from the honours and even from the alms of the Church.[722]

Much more commonly, however, the prohibition of a second marriage
refers only to a certain period after the husband’s death. Thus, among
the Chickasaws, widows were obliged to live a chaste single life for
three years at the risk of the law of adultery being executed against
the recusants;[723] whilst, among the Creeks, a widow was looked upon
as an adulteress if she spoke or made free with any man within four
summers after the death of her husband.[724] Among the Old Kukis,
widowers and widows could not marry within three years, and then
only with the permission of the family of the deceased.[725] Among
the Kunáma, too, the period of widowhood must not be shorter than
three years, in Saraë not less than two.[726] The Arawaks, British
Columbians, and Mandans required that the head of the widow should be
shaved, and she was not permitted to marry again before her shorn locks
regained their wonted length.[727] Among the Hovas, Ainos, Patagonians,
&c., the widow has to live a single life for a year at least after her
husband’s death,[728] and among some other peoples for six months.[729]

It may perhaps be supposed that the object of these prohibitions is to
remove all apprehensions as to pregnancy. But this cannot be the case
when the time of mourning lasts for a year or more. In Saraë, where a
widow is bound to celibacy for two years, a divorced wife is prevented
from marrying within two months only, as Munzinger says, “in order to
avoid all uncertainty as to pregnancy;”[730] and, among the Bedouins,
a divorced woman has, for the same reason, to remain unmarried for no
longer time than forty days.[731] Moreover, certain peoples, especially
those among whom monogamy is the only recognized form of marriage, or
among whom polygyny is practised as a rare exception, prohibit the
speedy remarriage not only of widows but of widowers.[732]

The meaning of the interdict appears also from the common rule that
a wife, after her husband’s death, shall give up all her ornaments,
and have her head shaved, her hair cut short, or her face blackened.
Among certain Indians, the law compels the widow through the long term
of her mourning to refrain from all public company and diversions,
under pain of being considered an adulteress, and, likewise to go with
flowing hair without the privilege of oil to anoint it;[733] whilst, in
Greenland tales, it is said of a truly disconsolate widow, “She mourns
so, that she cannot be recognised for dirt.”[734]

Hence we see how deep-rooted is the idea that a woman belongs
exclusively to one man. Savages believe that the soul of the deceased
can return and become a tormentor of the living. Thus a husband, even
after his death, may punish a wife who has proved unfaithful.

According to travellers’ statements, there are, indeed, peoples
almost devoid of the feeling of jealousy, and the practice of lending
or prostituting wives is generally taken as evidence of this. But
jealousy, as well as love, is far from being the same feeling in
the mind of a savage as in that of a civilized man. A wife is often
regarded as not very different from other property, and an adulterer as
a thief.[735] In some parts of Africa, he is punished as such, having
his hands, or one of them, cut off.[736] The fact that a man lends his
wife to a visitor no more implies the absence of jealousy than other
ways of showing hospitality imply that he is without the proprietary
feeling. According to Wilkes, the aborigines of New South Wales “will
frequently give one of their wives to a friend who may be in want of
one; but notwithstanding this laxity they are extremely jealous, and
are very prompt to resent any freedom taken with their wives.”[737]

A married woman is never permitted to cohabit with any man but the
husband, except with the husband’s permission; and this permission
is given only as an act of hospitality or friendship, or as a means
of profit. When we are told that a negro husband uses his wife for
entrapping other men and making them pay a heavy fine;[738] that, among
the Crees, adultery is considered no crime “provided the husband
receives a valuable consideration for his wife’s prostitution;”[739] or
that, in Nukahiva, husbands sometimes offer their wives to foreigners
“from their ardent desire of possessing iron, or other European
articles,”[740]—we must not infer from this profligacy that jealousy
is unknown to man at early stages of civilization. On the contrary,
such practices are due chiefly to contact with “higher culture,” which
often has the effect of misleading natural instincts. “Husbands,
after the degradation of a pseudo-civilization,” says Mr. Bonwick,
“are sometimes found ready to barter the virtue of a wife for a piece
of tobacco, a morsel of bread, or a silver sixpence.”[741] Mr. Curr
observes that, among the Australian natives, “husbands display much
less jealousy of white men than of those of their own colour,” and that
they will more commonly prostitute their wives to strangers visiting
the tribe than to their own people.[742] “Under no circumstances,”
says Sir George Grey, “is a strange native allowed to approach the
fire of a married man.”[743] According to Bosman, the Negroes of Benin
were very jealous of their wives with their own countrymen, though
not in the least with European foreigners;[744] and Lisiansky states
exactly the same as regards the Sandwich Islanders.[745] In California,
says Mr. Powers, “since the advent of the Americans the husband often
traffics in his wife’s honour for gain, and even forces her to infamy
when unwilling; though in early days he would have slain her without
pity and without remorse for the same offence.”[746] The like is true
of the Columbians about Puget Sound;[747] and Georgi remarks that
the nomadic Koriaks torment their wives by their jealousy, sometimes
even killing them from this passion; whereas those Koriaks who lead a
stationary life, being far more advanced in civilization, are so little
addicted to it, that they even have a relish for seeing foreigners make
love to their wives, whom they dress accordingly.[748]

If the hypothesis of an annual pairing time in the infancy of mankind
holds good, jealousy must at that stage have been a passion of very
great intensity.

It may, however, be supposed that this feeling, though belonging to
human nature, has been restrained by certain conditions which have
made it necessary, or desirable, for a man to share his wife with
other men. Thus polyandry now prevails in several parts of the world.
But I shall endeavour to show, later on, that this practice is due
chiefly to scarcity of women, and commonly implies an act of fraternal
benevolence, the eldest and first married brother in a family giving
his younger brothers a share in his wife, if they would otherwise be
obliged to live unmarried. Hence polyandry can by no means, as Mr.
McLennan suggests, be regarded as “a modification of and advance from
promiscuity.” It owes its origin to causes, or a cause, which never
would have produced general communism in women. Besides, it can be
proved that polyandry is abhorrent to the rudest races of men.

It has been suggested, too, that man’s gregarious way of living made
promiscuity necessary. The men of a group, it is said, must either have
quarrelled about their women and separated, splitting the horde into
hostile sections, or indulged in promiscuous intercourse. But it is
hard to understand why tribal organization in olden times should have
prevented a man having his special wife, since it does not do so among
savages still existing. Primitive law is the law of might; and it is
impossible to believe that the stronger men, who generally succeeded
in getting the most comely women, voluntarily gave their weaker
rivals a share in their precious capture. Regarding the aborigines
of Queensland, Lumholtz states that as a rule, it is difficult for
men to marry before they are thirty years of age, the old men having
the youngest and best-looking wives, while a young man must consider
himself fortunate if he can get an old woman.[749] It more commonly
happens among savages, however, that almost every full-grown man is
able to get a wife for himself; and when this is the case, there is
still less reason for assuming communism in women.

It is not, of course, impossible that, among some peoples, intercourse
between the sexes may have been almost promiscuous. But there is not a
shred of genuine evidence for the notion that promiscuity ever formed
a general stage in the social history of mankind. The hypothesis
of promiscuity, instead of belonging, as Professor Giraud-Teulon
thinks,[750] to the class of hypotheses which are scientifically
permissible, has no real foundation, and is essentially unscientific.




CHAPTER VII

MARRIAGE AND CELIBACY


With wild animals sexual desire is not less powerful as an incentive
to strenuous exertion than hunger and thirst. In the rut-time, the
males even of the most cowardly species engage in mortal combats; and
abstinence, or at least voluntary abstinence, is almost unheard of in a
state of nature.[751]

As regards savage and barbarous races of men, among whom the relations
of the sexes under normal conditions take the form of marriage,
nearly every individual strives to get married as soon as he, or she,
reaches the age of puberty.[752] Hence there are far fewer bachelors
and spinsters among them than among civilized peoples. Harmon found
that among the Blackfeet, Crees, Chippewyans, and other aboriginal
tribes on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, celibacy was a rare
exception;[753] and Ashe noted the same fact among the Shawanese.[754]
Prescott states of the Dacotahs, “I do not know of a bachelor among
them. They have a little more respect for the women and themselves,
than to live a single life.”[755] Indeed, according to Adair, many
Indian women thought virginity and widowhood the same as death.[756]
Among the Eastern Greenlanders, visited by Lieutenant Holm, only one
unmarried woman was met with.[757]

The Charruas, says Azara, “ne restent jamais dans le célibat, et ils
se marient aussitôt qu’ils sentent le besoin de cette union.”[758]
As regards the Yahgans, Mr. Bridges writes that “none but mutes and
imbeciles remained single, except some lads of vigour who did so from
choice, influenced by licentiousness. But no woman remained unmarried;
almost immediately on her husband’s death the widow found another
husband.”

Among the wild nations of Southern Africa, according to Burchell,
neither men nor women ever pass their lives in a state of
celibacy;[759] and Bosman assures us that very few negroes of the
Gold Coast died single, unless they were quite young.[760] Among the
Mandingoes, Caillié met with no instance of a young woman, pretty or
plain, who had not a husband.[761] Barth reports that the Western
Touaregs had no fault to find with him except that he lived in
celibacy; they could not even understand how this was possible.[762]

Among the Sinhalese there are hardly any old bachelors and old
maids;[763] and Mr. Marshall says of the Todas, “No unmarried class
exists, to disturb society with its loves and broils; ... it is a
‘very much married’ people. Every man and every woman, every lad and
every girl is somebody’s husband or wife; tied at the earliest possible
age.... With the exception of a cripple girl, and of those women who,
past the child-bearing age, were widows, I did not meet with a single
instance of unmarried adult females.”[764] Among the Toungtha, it
is unheard of for a man or woman to be unmarried after the age of
thirty, and among the Chukmas, a bachelor twenty-five years old is
rarely seen.[765] The Muásís consider it a father’s duty to fix upon
a bridegroom as soon as his daughter becomes marriageable.[766] Among
the Burmese[767] and the Hill Dyaks of Borneo,[768] old maids and old
bachelors are alike unknown. Among the Sumatrans, too, instances of
persons of either sex passing their lives in a state of celibacy are
extremely rare:—“In the districts under my charge,” says Marsden,
“are about eight thousand inhabitants, among whom I do not conceive
it would be possible to find ten instances of men of the age of thirty
years unmarried.”[769] In Java, Mr. Crawfurd “never saw a woman of
two-and-twenty that was not, or had not been, married.”[770] In Tonga,
according to Mariner, there were but few women who, from whim or
some accidental cause, remained single for life.[771] In Australia,
“nearly all the girls are betrothed at a very early age;” and Mr.
Curr never heard of a woman, over sixteen years of age, who, prior to
the breakdown of aboriginal customs after the coming of the Whites,
had not a husband.[772] As to the natives of Herbert River, Northern
Queensland, Herr Lumholtz says that though the majority of the young
men have to wait a long time before they get wives, it is rare for a
man to die unmarried.[773]

Indeed, so indispensable does marriage seem to uncivilized man, that
a person who does not marry is looked upon almost as an unnatural
being, or, at any rate, is disdained.[774] Among the Santals, if a
man remains single, “he is at once despised by both sexes, and is
classed next to a thief, or a witch: they term the unhappy wretch
‘No man.’”[775] Among the Kafirs, a bachelor has no voice in the
kraal.[776] The Tipperahs, as we are told by Mr. J. F. Browne, do not
consider a man a person of any importance till he is married;[777]
and, in the Tupi tribes, no man was suffered to partake of the
drinking-feast while he remained single.[778] The Fijians even believed
that he who died wifeless was stopped by the god Nangganangga on the
road to Paradise, and smashed to atoms.[779]

It may also be said that savages, as a rule, marry earlier in life
than civilized men. A Greenlander, says Dr. Nansen, often marries
before there is any chance of the union being productive.[780] Among
the Californians, Mandans, and most of the north-western tribes in
North America, marriage frequently takes place at the age of twelve
or fourteen.[781] In the wild tribes of Central Mexico, girls are
seldom unmarried after the age of fourteen or fifteen.[782] Among the
Talamanca Indians, a bride is generally from ten to fourteen years old,
whilst a man seldom becomes a husband before fourteen.[783] In certain
other Central American tribes, the parents try to get a wife for their
son when he is nine or ten years old.[784]

Among the natives of Brazil, the man generally marries at the age of
from fifteen to eighteen, the woman from ten to twelve.[785] According
to Azara, the like was the case with the Guaranies of the Plata,
whilst, among the Guanas, “celle qui se marie le plus tard, se marie à
neuf ans.”[786] In Tierra del Fuego, as we are informed by Lieutenant
Bove, a girl looks about for a husband when twelve or thirteen years
old, and a youth marries at the age of from fourteen to sixteen.[787]

Many African peoples, _e.g._, the Abyssinians,[788] the Beni-Amer,
the Djour tribes on the White Nile,[789] the Arabs of the Sahara, the
Wakamba, and the Ba-kwileh,[790] are likewise said to marry very young.
Marriage usually takes place, among the Bongos when they are from
fifteen to seventeen years old, but in many other tribes at an earlier
age.[791]

Among the Sinhalese, when a young man has reached the age of eighteen
or twenty, it is the duty of his father to provide him with a proper
wife.[792] Among the Bodo and Dhimáls, “marriage takes place at
maturity, the male being usually from twenty to twenty-five years of
age, and the female from fifteen to twenty.”[793] A Santal lad marries,
as a rule, about the age of sixteen or seventeen, and a girl at that
of fifteen;[794] whilst a Kandh boy marries when he reaches his tenth
or twelfth year, his wife being usually about four years older.[795]
The Khyoungtha,[796] Munda Kols,[797] Red Karens,[798] Siamese,[799]
Burmese,[800] Mongols,[801] and other Asiatic peoples, are also known
to marry early. Among the Ainos, the young women are considered
marriageable at the age of sixteen or seventeen, and the men marry
when about nineteen or twenty.[802] Again, among the Lake Dwellers of
Lob-nor, girls enter into matrimony at the age of fourteen or fifteen,
men at the same age, or a little later;[803] whilst, among the Malays,
according to Mr. Bickmore, the boys usually marry for the first time
when about sixteen, and the girls at the age of thirteen or fourteen,
and occasionally still earlier.[804]

Passing to the Australian continent: among the natives of New South
Wales, the parties are in most cases betrothed very early in life, the
young man claiming his wife later on, as soon as he arrives at the
proper age.[805] According to Mr. Curr, “girls become wives at from
eight to fourteen years of age.”[806] At Port Moresby, New Guinea,
“few men over twenty years of age remain single;” and the Maoris in
New Zealand are stated to marry very young.[807]

Moreover, celibacy is comparatively rare not only among savage and
barbarous, but among several civilized races.

Among the Azteks, no young man lived single till his twenty-second
year, unless he intended to become a priest, and for girls the
customary marrying-age was from eleven to eighteen. In Tlascala,
according to Clavigero, the unmarried state was, indeed, so despised
that a full-grown man who would not marry had his hair cut off for
shame.[808] Again, among the ancient Peruvians, every year, or every
two years, each governor in his district had to arrange for the
marriage of all the young men at the age of twenty-four and upwards,
and all the girls from eighteen to twenty.[809]

In Japan, as I am told by a Japanese friend, old maids and old
bachelors are almost entirely unknown, and the same is the case in
China.[810] “Almost all Chinese,” says Dr. Gray, “robust or infirm,
well-formed or deformed, are called upon by their parents to marry so
soon as they have attained the age of puberty. Were a grown-up son
or daughter to die unmarried, the parents would regard it as most
deplorable.” Hence a young man of marriageable age, whom consumption
or any other lingering disease had marked for its own, would be called
upon by his parents or guardians to marry at once.[811] Nay, so
indispensable is marriage considered among this people, that even the
dead are married. Thus the spirits of all males who die in infancy, or
in boyhood, are in due time married to the spirits of females who have
been cut off at a like early age.[812]

Marco Polo states the prevalence of the same practice among the
Tartars.[813] In Corea, says the Rev. John Ross, “the male human being
who is unmarried is never called a ‘man,’ whatever his age, but goes
by the name of ‘yatow;’ a name given by the Chinese to unmarriageable
young girls: and the ‘man’ of thirteen or fourteen has a perfect right
to strike, abuse, order about the ‘yatow’ of thirty, who dares not as
much as open his lips to complain.”[814]

Mohammedan peoples generally consider marriage a duty both for men and
women.[815] “Nothing,” says Carsten Niebuhr, “is more rarely to be
met with in the East, than a woman unmarried after a certain time of
life.” She will rather marry a poor man, or become second wife to a man
already married, than remain in a state of celibacy.[816] Among the
Persians, for instance, almost every girl of good repute is married
before her twenty-first year, and old bachelors are unknown.[817] In
Egypt, according to Mr. Lane, it is improper and even disreputable to
abstain from marrying when a man has attained a sufficient age, and
when there is no just impediment.[818]

Among the Hebrews, celibacy was nearly unheard of, as it is among the
Jews of our day. They have a proverb that “he who has no wife is no
man.”[819] “To an ancient Israelite,” Michaelis remarks, “it would
indeed have appeared very strange to have seen, though but in a vision,
a period in the future history of the world, when it would be counted
sanctity and religion to live unmarried.”[820] Marriage was by the
Hebrews looked upon as a religious duty. According to the Talmud, the
authorities can compel a man to marry, and he who lives single at the
age of twenty is accursed by God almost as if he were a murderer.[821]

The ancient nations of the Aryan stock, as M. Fustel de Coulanges
and others have pointed out, regarded celibacy as an impiety and
a misfortune: “an impiety, because one who did not marry put the
happiness of the Manes of the family in peril; a misfortune, because he
himself would receive no worship after his death.” A man’s happiness
in the next world depended upon his having a continuous line of male
descendants, whose duty it would be to make the periodical offerings
for the repose of his soul.[822]

Thus, according to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ marriage is the twelfth
Sanskāra, and hence a religious duty incumbent upon all.[823] “Until
he finds a wife, a man is only half of a whole,” we read in the
‘Brahmadharma’;[824] and, among the Hindus of the present day, a man
who is not married is considered to be almost a useless member of
society, and is, indeed, looked upon as beyond the pale of nature. It
is also an established national rule, that women are designed for no
other end than to be subservient to the wants and pleasures of men;
consequently, all women without exception are obliged to marry, when
husbands can be found for them, and those who cannot find a husband
commonly fall into the state of concubinage.[825] Among the ancient
Iranians, too, it was considered a matter of course that a girl should
be married on reaching the years of puberty.[826]

The ancient Greeks regarded marriage as a matter not merely of private,
but also of public interest. This was particularly the case at Sparta,
where criminal proceedings might be taken against those who married
too late, and against those who did not marry at all. In Solon’s
legislation marriage was also placed under the inspection of the State,
and, at Athens, persons who did not marry might be prosecuted, although
the law seems to have grown obsolete in later times. But independently
of public considerations, there were private reasons which made
marriage an obligation.[827] Plato remarks that every individual is
bound to provide for a continuance of representatives to succeed
himself as ministers of the Divinity;[828] and Isaeus says, “All they
who think their end approaching, look forward with a prudent care that
their houses may not become desolate, but that there may be some person
to attend to their funeral rites, and to perform the legal ceremonies
at their tombs.”[829]

To the Roman citizen, as Mommsen observes, a house of his own and the
blessing of children appeared the end and essence of life;[830] and
Cicero’s treatise ‘De Legibus’—a treatise which generally reproduces,
in a philosophic form, the ancient laws of Rome—contains a law,
according to which the Censors had to impose a tax upon unmarried
men.[831] But in later periods, when sexual morality reached a very low
ebb in Rome, celibacy—as to which grave complaints were made as early
as 520 B.C.—naturally increased in proportion, especially among the
well-off classes. Among these, marriage came to be regarded as a burden
which people took upon themselves at the best in the public interest.
Indeed, how it fared with marriage and the rearing of children, is
shown by the Gracchan agrarian laws, which first placed a premium
thereon;[832] whilst, later on, the _Lex Julia et Papia Poppæa_ imposed
various penalties on those who lived in a state of celibacy after a
certain age,[833]—but with little or no result.[834]

Again, the Germans, as described by Cæsar, accounted it in the highest
degree scandalous to have intercourse with the other sex before the
twentieth year.[835] Tacitus also asserts that the young men married
late, and the maidens did not hurry into marriage.[836] But it seems
probable that at a later age celibacy was almost unknown among
the Germans, except in the case of women who had once lost their
reputation, for whom neither beauty, youth, nor riches could procure a
husband.[837] As for the Slavs, it should be observed that, among the
Russian peasantry celibacy is even now unheard of.[838] When a youth
reaches the age of eighteen, he is informed by his parents that he
ought to marry at once.[839]

There are, however, even in savage life, circumstances which compel
certain persons to live unmarried for a longer or shorter time. When a
wife has to be bought, a man must of course have some fortune before he
is able to marry. Thus, as regards the Zulus, Mr. Eyles writes to me
that “young men who are without cattle have often to wait many years
before getting married.”[840] When Major-General Campbell asked some
of the Kandhs why they remained single, they replied that they did so
because wives were too expensive.[841] Among the Munda Kols and Hos,
in consequence of the high prices of brides, are to be found “what
are probably not known to exist in other parts of India, respectable
elderly maidens.”[842] In the New Britain Group, too, according to Mr.
Romilly, the purchase sum is never fixed at too low a price, hence “it
constantly happens that the intended husband is middle-aged before he
can marry.”[843] Similar statements are made in a good many books of
travels.[844]

Polygyny, in connection with slavery and the unequal distribution
of property, acts in the same direction. In Makin, one of the
Kingsmill Islands, a great number of young men were unmarried owing
to the majority of the women being monopolized by the wealthy and
powerful.[845] Among the Bakongo, according to Mr. Ingham, as also
among the Australians,[846] polygyny causes celibacy among the poorer
and younger men; and Dr. Sims says the like of the Bateke, Mr. Cousins
of the Kafirs, Mr. Radfield of the inhabitants of Lifu. Among the
Kutchin Indians, according to Hardisty, there are but few young men who
have wives—unless they can content themselves with some old cast-off
widow—on account of all the chiefs, medicine men, and those who possess
rank acquired by property having two, three, or more wives.[847] For
the same reason many men of the lower classes of the Waganda are
obliged to remain single, in spite of the large surplus of women.[848]
In Micronesia, also, it is common for the poorer class and the slaves
to be doomed to perpetual celibacy.[849] Among the Thlinkets, a slave
cannot acquire property, nor marry, except by consent of his master,
which is rarely given;[850] and in the Soudan the case seems to be the
same.[851]

But we must not exaggerate the importance of these obstacles to
marriage. When the man is not able to buy a wife for himself, he may,
in many cases, acquire her by working for some time with her parents,
or by eloping with her. Moreover, as Sir John Lubbock remarks, the
price of a wife is generally regulated by the circumstances of the
tribe, so that nearly every industrious young man is enabled to
get one.[852] Speaking of the Sumatrans, Marsden observes that the
necessity of purchasing does not prove such an obstacle to matrimony as
is supposed, for there are few families who are not in possession of
some small substance, and the purchase-money of the daughters serves
also to provide wives for the sons.[853] Again, polygyny is, as we
shall see further on, almost everywhere restricted to a small minority
of the people, and is very often connected with the fact that there is
a surplus of women. Thus, among the polygynous Waguha, as I am informed
by Mr. Swann, unmarried grown-up men do not exist, the women being more
numerous than the men. At any rate, we may conclude that at earlier
stages of civilization, when polygyny was practised less extensively
and women were less precious chattels than they afterwards became,
celibacy was a much rarer exception than it is now among many of the
lower races.

Passing to the peoples of Europe, we find, from the evidence adduced by
statisticians, that modern civilization has proved very unfavourable
to the number of marriages. In civilized Europe, in 1875, more than a
third of the male and female population beyond the age of fifteen lived
in a state of voluntary or involuntary celibacy. Excluding Russia, the
number of celibates varied from 25·57 per cent. in Hungary to 44·93 per
cent. in Belgium. And among them there are many who never marry.[854]
In the middle of this century, Wappäus found that, in Saxony, 14·6 per
cent. of the unmarried adult population died single; in Sweden, 14·9
per cent.; in the Netherlands, 17·2 per cent.; and in France, 20·6
per cent.[855] Of the rest, many marry comparatively late in life.
Thus, in Denmark, only 19·43 per cent. of the married men were under
twenty-five, and in Bavaria (in 1870-1878), only 16.36, whilst the
figures for England and Russia look more favourable, being respectively
51·90 per cent. (in 1872-1878), and 68·31 per cent. (in 1867-1875). Of
the married women, on the other hand, only 5·09 per cent. are below
the age of twenty in Sweden, 5·40 per cent. in Bavaria, 7·44 per cent.
in Saxony, 14·86 per cent. in England, &c.; but in Hungary as many as
35·16 per cent., and in Russia even 57·27 per cent.[856] The mean age
of the bachelors who enter into matrimony is 26 years in England and
28·48 in France, that of the spinsters respectively 24·07 and 25·3.[857]

As a rule, the proportion of unmarried people has been gradually
increasing in Europe during this century,[858] and the age at which
people marry has risen. In England we need not go further back than
two decades, to find a greater tendency on the part of men to defer
marriage to later age than was formerly the case.[859] Finally, it must
be noted that in country districts single men and women are more seldom
met with, and marriage is generally concluded earlier in life, than in
towns.[860]

There are, indeed, several factors in modern civilization which account
for the comparatively large number of celibates. In countries where
polygyny is permitted, women have a better chance of getting married
than men, but in Europe the case is reversed. Here, as in most parts
of the world, the adult women outnumber the adult men. If we reckon
the age for marriage from twenty to fifty years, a hundred men may, in
Europe, choose amongst a hundred and three or four women, so that about
three or four women per cent. are doomed to a single life on account of
our obligatory monogamy.[861]

The chief cause, however, of increasing celibacy is the difficulty of
supporting a family in modern society. The importance of this factor
is distinctly proved by statistics. It has been observed that the
frequency of marriages is a very sensible barometer of the hopes which
the mass of people have for the future; hard times, wars, commercial
crises, &c., regularly depressing the number of marriages, whilst
comparative abundance has the opposite effect.[862]

In non-European countries into which a precocious civilization has
not been introduced, the population is more nearly in proportion to
the means of subsistence, and people adapt their mode of life more
readily to their circumstances. In most cases a man can earn his
living sooner;[863] and a wife far from being a burden to her husband,
is rather a help to him, being his labourer or sometimes even his
supporter. Moreover, children, instead of requiring an education that
would absorb the father’s earnings, become, on the contrary, a source
of income. Thus Mr. Bickmore asserts that, among the Malays, difficulty
in supporting a family is unknown.[864] Carsten Niebuhr states that, in
the East, men are as disposed to marry as women, “because their wives,
instead of being expensive, are rather profitable to them.”[865] And,
speaking of the American Indians, Heriot says that children form the
wealth of savage tribes.[866]

To a certain extent, the like is true of the agricultural classes of
Europe. A peasant’s wife helps her husband in the field, tends the
cattle, and takes part in the fishing. She cooks and washes, sews,
spins, and weaves. In a word, she does many useful things about which
women of the well-off classes never think of troubling themselves.
Hence in Russia, as we are informed by M. Pietro Semenow, the small
agriculturists, who form an enormous proportion of the population, are
in the habit of arranging for the marriage of their sons at as early an
age as possible in order to secure an additional female labourer.[867]

Even in cities it is not among the poorest classes that celibacy is
most frequent. A “gentleman,” before marrying, thinks it necessary to
have an income of which a mere fraction would suffice for a married
workman. He has to offer his wife a home in accordance with her
social position and his own; and unless she brings him some fortune,
she contributes but little to the support of the family. Professor
Vallis has made out that, in the nobility and higher _bourgeoisie_ of
Sweden, only 32 per cent. of the male population and 26 per cent. of
the female population are married, whilst the averages for the whole
population amount to 34 and 32 per cent. respectively.[868] Some such
disproportion must always exist when the habits of life are luxurious,
and the amount of income does not correspond to them. And it is obvious
that women have to suffer from this trouble more than men, the life of
many of them being comparatively so useless, and their pretensions,
nevertheless, so high.

Another reason why the age for marriage has been raised by advancing
civilization is, that a man requires more time to gain his living by
intellectual than by material work. Thus, miners, tailors, shoemakers,
artisans, &c., who earn in youth almost as much as in later life,
marry, as a rule, earlier than men of the professional class.[869] In
most European countries the decrease in the number of married people is
also partly due to the drafting of young men into the army, and their
retention in it in enforced bachelorhood during the years when nature
most strongly urges to matrimony.

Of course these conditions affect directly the marriage age only of
men, but indirectly they influence that of women also. Many fall in
love with their future wives long before they are able to form a home,
and those who marry late generally avoid very great disparity of
age.[870]

In one respect the average age at which women marry may be said to
depend directly upon the degree of civilization. Dr. Ploss has justly
pointed out that the ruder a people is, and the more exclusively a
woman is valued as an object of desire, or as a slave, the earlier in
life is she generally chosen;[871] whereas, if marriage becomes a union
of souls as well as of bodies, the man claims a higher degree of mental
maturity from the woman he wishes to be his wife.

At the lower stages of human development, the pleasures of life consist
chiefly in the satisfaction of natural wants and instincts. Hence
savages and barbarians scarcely ever dream of voluntarily denying
themselves “domestic bliss.” But, as a writer in ‘The Nation’ says,
“by the general diffusion of education and culture, by the new
inventions and discoveries of the age, by the increase of commerce
and intercourse and wealth, the tastes of men and women have become
widened, their desires multiplied, new gratifications and pleasures
have been supplied to them. By this increase of the gratifications of
existence the relative share of them which married life affords has
become just so much less. The domestic circle does not fill so large a
place in life as formerly. It is really less important to either man
or woman. Married life has lost in some measure its advantage over a
single life. There are so many more pleasures, now, that can be enjoyed
as well or even better in celibacy.”[872]

It has further been suggested that the development of the mental
faculties has made the sexual impulse less powerful. That instinct
is said to be most excessive in animals which least excel in
intelligence, the beasts which are the most lascivious, as the ass,
the boar, &c., being also the most stupid;[873] and M. Forel even
believes that, among the ants, increase of mind-power may have led to
the sterility of the workers.[874] Idiots, too, are known to display
very gross sensuality.[875] Yet the suggestion that decrease of sexual
desire is a necessary attendant upon mental evolution cannot, so far as
I know, by any means be considered scientifically proved, though we may
safely say that if, among primitive men, pairing was restricted to one
season of the year, the sexual instinct became gradually less intense
as it became less periodical. A higher degree of forethought and
self-control has, moreover, to a certain extent put the drag on human
passions.

Finally, there can be no doubt that the higher development of feeling
has helped to increase the number of those who remain single. “By
the diffusion of a finer culture throughout the community,” says
the above-mentioned writer in ‘The Nation,’ “men and women can
less easily find any one whom they are willing to take as a partner
for life; their requirements are more exacting; their standards of
excellence higher; they are less able to find any who can satisfy their
own ideal, and less able to satisfy anybody else’s ideal. Men and
women have, too, a livelier sense of the serious and sacred character
of the marriage union, and of the high motives from which alone it
should be formed. They are less willing to contract it from any lower
motives.”[876]

In what direction is the civilized world tending with regard to these
matters? Will the number of celibates increase as hitherto, or will
there be some backward movement in that respect? A definite answer
cannot yet be given, since much will depend on economical conditions
which it is impossible at present to foresee.

       *       *       *       *       *

Before this chapter is closed, it may be worth while to glance at the
curious notion that there is something impure and sinful in marriage,
as in sexual relations generally. The missionary Jellinghaus found
this idea prevalent among the Munda Kols in Chota Nagpore. Once when
he asked them, “May a dog sin?” the answer was, “If the dog did
not sin how could he breed?”[877] In Efate, of the New Hebrides,
according to Mr. Macdonald, sexual intercourse is regarded as something
unclean;[878] and the Tahitians believed that, if a man refrained
from all connection with women some months before death, he passed
immediately into his eternal mansion without any purification.[879]
It is perhaps for a similar reason that the Shawanese have a great
respect for certain persons who observe celibacy,[880] and that,
among the Californian Karok, a man who touches a woman within three
days before going out hunting is believed to miss the quarry.[881]
Among several peoples, as the Brazilian aborigines,[882] the Papuans
of New Guinea,[883] certain tribes in Australia,[884] the Khyoungtha
of the Chittagong Hills,[885] and the Khevsurs of the Caucasus,[886]
continence is required from newly married people for some time
after marriage. The same is the case with several peoples of Aryan
origin; and Dr. v. Schroeder even believes that this custom can be
traced back to the primitive times of the Indo-European race.[887]
In ancient Mexico, the Mazatek bridegroom kept apart from the bride
during the first fifteen days of his wedded life, both spending the
time in fasting and penance.[888] In Greenland, according to Egede, if
married couples had children before a year was past, or if they had
large families, they were blamed, and compared to dogs.[889] In Fiji,
husbands and wives do not usually spend the night together, except as
it were by stealth; it is quite contrary to Fijian ideas of delicacy
that they should sleep under the same roof. Thus a man spends the day
with his family, but absents himself on the approach of night.[890]
Speaking of certain American Indians, Lafitau remarks, “Ils n’osent
aller dans les cabanes particulières où habitent leurs épouses, que
durant l’obscurité de la nuit; ... ce seroit une action extraordinaire
de s’y présenter de jour.”[891] Moreover, in spite of the great
licentiousness of many savage races, a veil of modesty, however
transparent, is generally drawn over the relations of the sexes.[892]

The same notion of impurity doubtless explains the fact that certain
persons devoted to religion have to live a single life. In the
Marquesas Islands, no one could become a priest without having lived
chastely for several years previously.[893] In Patagonia, according
to Falkner, the male wizards were not allowed to marry,[894] and the
same prohibition applied to the priests of the Mosquito Indians and
the ancient Mexicans.[895] In Peru, there were virgins dedicated to
the Sun, who lived in seclusion to the end of their lives; and besides
the virgins who professed perpetual virginity in the monasteries,
there were other women, of the blood royal, who led the same life in
their own houses, having taken a vow of chastity. “These women,”
says Garcilasso de la Vega, “were held in great veneration for their
chastity and purity, and, as a mark of worship and respect, they were
called ‘Occlo,’ which was a name held sacred in their idolatry.”[896]
In Mexico, also, certain religious women were bound to chastity,
although their profession was but for one year. Speaking of these nuns,
the pious Father Acosta remarks, “The devil hath desired to be served
by them that observe Virginitie, not that chastitie is pleasing unto
him, for he is an uncleane spirite, but for the desire he hath to take
from the great God, as much as in him lieth, this glory to be served
with cleanness and integrity.”[897] Justinus tells us of Persian Sun
priestesses, who, like the Roman vestals and certain Greek priestesses,
were obliged to refrain from intercourse with men;[898] and according
to Pomponius Mela, the nine priestesses of the oracle of a Gallic deity
in Sena were devoted to perpetual virginity.[899]

The Buddhistic doctrine teaches that lust and ignorance are the two
great causes of the misery of life, and that we should therefore
suppress lust and remove ignorance. We read in the ‘Dhammika-Sutta’
that “a wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning
pit of live coals.”[900] Sensuality is altogether incompatible with
wisdom and holiness. According to the legend, Buddha’s mother, who
was the best and purest of the daughters of men, had no other sons,
and her conception was due to supernatural causes.[901] And one of
the fundamental duties of monastic life, by an infringement of which
the guilty person brings about his inevitable expulsion from Buddha’s
Order, is, that “an ordained monk may not have sexual intercourse, not
even with an animal. The monk who has sexual intercourse is no longer
a monk.”[902] Mr. Wilson, indeed, states that, in Tibet, some sects of
the Lamas are allowed to marry; but those who do not are considered
more holy. And in every sect the nuns must take a vow of absolute
continence.[903] Again, the Chinese laws enjoin celibacy upon all
priests, Buddhist or Taouist.[904]

In India, where, according to Sir Monier Williams, married life has
been more universally honoured than in any other country of the world,
celibacy has, nevertheless, in instances of extraordinary sanctity,
always commanded respect.[905] “Those of their Sannyâsis,” says
Dubois, “who are known to lead their lives in perfect celibacy,
receive, on that account, marks of distinguished honour and respect.”
But the single state, which is allowed to those who devote themselves
to a life of contemplation, is not tolerated in any class of women.[906]

Among a small class of Hebrews, too, the idea that marriage is impure
gradually took root. The Essenes, says Josephus, “reject pleasures
as an evil, but esteem continence and the conquest over our passions
to be virtue. They neglect wedlock.”[907] This doctrine exercised
no influence upon Judaism, but probably much upon Christianity. St.
Paul held celibacy to be preferable to marriage:—“He that giveth his
virgin in marriage doeth well,” he says; “but he that giveth her
not in marriage doeth better.”[908] Yet, as for most men continence
is not possible, marriage is for them not only a right but a duty.
“It is good for a man not to touch a woman; nevertheless, to avoid
fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have
her own husband.... If they (the unmarried and widows) cannot contain,
let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.”[909] A much
stronger opinion as to the superiority of celibacy is expressed by
most of the Fathers of the Church. Origen thought marriage profane and
impure. Tertullian says that celibacy must be chosen, even if mankind
should perish. According to St Augustine, the unmarried children will
shine in heaven as beaming stars, whilst their parents will look
like the dim ones.[910] Indeed, as Mr. Lecky observes, the cardinal
virtue of the religious type became the absolute suppression of the
whole sensual side of our nature, and theology made the indulgence of
one passion almost the sole unchristian sin.[911] It was a favourite
opinion among the Fathers that, if Adam had preserved his obedience to
the Creator, he would have lived for ever in a state of virgin purity,
and that some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise
with a race of innocent and immortal beings. The use of marriage was in
fact permitted to his fallen posterity only as a necessary expedient
for the continuance of the human species, and as a restraint, however
imperfect, on the natural licentiousness of desire.[912] But, though it
may be marriage that fills the earth, says St. Jerome, it is virginity
that replenishes heaven.[913]

These opinions led by degrees to the obligatory celibacy of the secular
and regular clergy. The New Testament gives us no intimation that,
during the lifetime of the apostles, monastic vows were taken by men
of any age, or by unmarried women, and hardly any of the apostles
themselves were celibates.[914] But gradually, as continence came to
be regarded as a cardinal virtue, and celibacy as the nearest approach
to the Divine perfection, a notion that the married state is not
consistent with the functions of the clergy became general. As early
as the end of the fourth century, the continence of the higher grades
of ecclesiastics was insisted on by a Roman synod, but no definite
punishment was ordered for its violation.[915] Gregory VII.—who “looked
with abhorrence on the contamination of the holy sacerdotal character,
even in its lowest degree, by any sexual connection”—was the first who
prescribed with sufficient force the celibacy of the clergy. Yet, in
many countries, it was so strenuously resisted, that it could not be
carried through till late in the thirteenth century.[916]

As for the origin of this notion of sexual uncleanness, it may
perhaps be connected with the instinctive feeling, to be dealt with
later on, against intercourse between members of the same family or
household. Experience, I think, tends to prove that there exists a
close association between these two feelings, which shows itself
in many ways. Sexual love is entirely banished from the sphere of
domestic life, and it is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that when it
appears in other relations, an association of ideas attaches a notion
of impurity to the desire and a notion of shame to its gratification.
Evidently, also, the religious enforcement of celibacy is intimately
allied to the belief that sexual intercourse is the great transmitter
of original sin, as well as to the abhorrence of every enjoyment which
is considered to degrade the spiritual nature of man.




CHAPTER VIII

THE COURTSHIP OF MAN


Speaking of the male and female reproductive cells of plants, Professor
Sachs remarks that, wherever we are able to observe an external
difference between the two, the male cell behaves actively in the
union, the female passively.[917] In this respect there is an analogy
between plants and many of the lower animals. In the case of some
lowly-organised animals, which are permanently affixed to the same
spot, the male element is invariably brought to the female. There are
other instances in which the females alone are fixed, and the males
must be the seekers. Even when the males and females of a species
are both free, it is almost always the males that first approach the
females.[918]

As Mr. Darwin points out, we can see the reason why, in the first
instance, the male plays the active part:—“Even if the ova were
detached before fertilisation, and did not require subsequent
nourishment or protection, there would yet be greater difficulty in
transporting them than the male element because, being larger than
the latter, they are produced in far smaller numbers.”[919] He adds,
however, that, with respect to forms of which the progenitors were
primordially free, it is difficult to understand why the males should
invariably have acquired the habit of approaching the females, instead
of being approached by them. Perhaps the explanation may be that the
seeker is more exposed to danger than the one sought after, and that
the death of a male at the pairing time is less disadvantageous for
the existence of the species than the death of a female. At any rate,
we may say with Mr. Darwin that it is necessary that the males should
be endowed with strong passions in order that they may be efficient
seekers; and the acquirement of such passions would naturally follow
from the more eager males leaving a larger number of offspring than the
less eager.[920]

The rule holds good for the human race, the man generally playing a
more active, the woman a more passive, part in courtship. The latter,
as it has been said, “requires to be courted.” Yet, curiously enough,
there are a few peoples among whom the reverse seems to be the case,
just as, among the lower animals also, there are some species of which
the females are the courters.[921] Among the Moquis in New Mexico,
according to Dr. Broeck, “instead of the swain asking the hand of the
fair one, she selects the young man who is to her fancy, and then her
father proposes the match to the sire of the lucky youth.”[922] In
Paraguay, we are told, the women were generally endowed with stronger
passions than the men,[923] and were allowed to make proposals;[924]
and among the Garos, according to Colonel Dalton, it is not only
the privilege but even the duty of the girl to speak first, any
infringement of this rule being summarily and severely punished. “If
a male makes advances to a girl,” he says, “and the latter, rejecting
them, chooses also to tell her friends that such tenders of affection
have been made to her, it is looked on as an insult to the whole
‘mahári’ (motherhood) to which the girl belongs, a stain only to be
obliterated by the blood of pigs, and liberal libations of beer at the
expense of the ‘mahári’ to which the man belongs.”[925] According
to Mr. Batchelor, it constantly occurs among the Ainos that the
proposal of marriage comes in the first place from the girl;[926] and
in Polynesia,[927] as also among the Kafirs of Natal[928] and certain
tribes in Oregon,[929] the same is sometimes the case.

It often happens that the parents of both parties make up the match;
and among several peoples the man pays his suit by proxy. But these
instances are of no particular importance.

       *       *       *       *       *

In most animal species courtship takes place in nearly the same way.
During the season of love, the males even of the most timid animals
engage in desperate combats with each other for the possession of the
female, and she, although comparatively passive, nevertheless often
exercises a choice, selecting one of the rivals. This fighting for a
female occurs even among insects,[930] and is of universal prevalence
in the order of the Vertebrata. We may, with Haeckel, regard it as a
modification and a special kind of the struggle for existence.[931]

There can be no doubt that our primeval human ancestors had, in the
same way, to combat for their brides. Even now this kind of courtship
is far from being unknown. Speaking of the Northern Indians, Hearne
states that “it has ever been the custom among those people for the men
to wrestle for any woman to whom they are attached; and, of course, the
strongest party always carries off the prize. A weak man, unless he
be a good hunter and well-beloved, is seldom permitted to keep a wife
that a stronger man thinks worth his notice.... This custom prevails
throughout all their tribes, and causes a great spirit of emulation
among their youth, who are upon all occasions, from their childhood,
trying their strength and skill in wrestling.[932] Richardson also saw,
more than once, a stronger man assert his right to take the wife of a
weaker countryman. “Any one,” he says, “may challenge another to
wrestle, and, if he overcomes, may carry off his wife as the prize....
The bereaved husband meets his loss with the resignation which custom
prescribes in such a case, and seeks his revenge by taking the wife
of another man weaker than himself.”[933] With reference to the Slave
Indians, Mr. Hooper says, “If a man desire to despoil his neighbour of
his wife, a trial of strength of a curious nature ensues: they seize
each other by the hair, which is worn long and flowing, and thus strive
for the mastery, until one or another cries _peccavi_. Should the
victor be the envious man, he has to pay a certain number of skins for
the husband-changing woman.”[934]

Among the Californians also, conflicting claims sometimes arise
between two or more men in regard to a woman; and, among the Patwin,
it occasionally happened that men who had a quarrel about a woman
fought a duel with bows and arrows at long distances.[935] In Mexico,
a duel often decided the conflict between two competing suitors.[936]
Among the Guanas, according to Azara, the men frequently do not marry
till they are twenty years old or more, as before that age they cannot
conquer their rivals.[937] Among the Muras, the wives are most commonly
gained in a combat with fists between all the lovers of the girl; and
the same is the case with the Passés.[938]

Among the Australian aborigines, quarrels are perhaps for the most
part occasioned by “the fair sex.”[939] Speaking of the natives near
Herbert Vale, Northern Queensland, Herr Lumholtz says that, “if a
woman is good-looking, all the men want her, and the one who is most
influential, or who is the strongest, is accordingly generally the
victor.”[940] Hence, the majority of the young men must wait a long
time before they get wives, as they have not the courage to fight the
requisite duel for one with an older man.[941] In the tribes of Western
Victoria, described by Mr. Dawson, a young chief who cannot get a wife,
and falls in love with one belonging to a chief who has more than two,
can, with her consent, challenge the husband to single combat, and, if
the husband is defeated, the conqueror makes her his legal wife.[942]
Narcisse Peltier, who, during seventeen years, was detained by a tribe
of Queensland Australians, states that the men “not unfrequently fight
with spears for the possession of a woman.”[943]

In New Zealand, if a girl had two suitors with equal pretensions, a
kind of “pulling match” was arranged in which the girl’s arms were
dragged by each of the suitors in opposite directions, the stronger
man being the victor;[944] and, according to the Rev. R. Taylor, there
is in the Maori language even a special term for denoting such a
struggle.[945] In Samoa, as also in the Fiji Islands, women have always
been one of the chief causes of fighting;[946] and of the natives of
Makin, of the Kingsmill Group, Mr. Wood assures us that “they have
no wars, and very few arms, and seldom quarrel except about their
women.”[947]

Among the South African Bushmans, the “stronger man will sometimes
take away the wife of the weaker.”[948] The people of Wadaï are
notorious for their desperate fights for women; and, among the young
men of Baghirmi, bloody feuds between rivals are far from being of rare
occurrence.[949]

In the islands outside Kamchatka there prevailed formerly a very
curious custom, as reported by Steller. If a husband found that a rival
had been with his wife, he would admit that the rival had at least an
equal claim to her. “Let us try, then,” he would say, “which of us
has the greater right, and shall have her.” After that they would take
off their clothes and begin to beat each other’s backs with sticks;
and he who first fell to the ground, unable to bear any more blows,
lost his right to the woman.[950]

Among the ancient Hindus, says Mr. Samuelson, “it was a custom in
royal circles, when a princess became marriageable, for a tournament
to be held, and the victor was chosen by the princess as her husband.”
This custom was known as the “Swayamvara,” or “Maiden’s Choice,” and
it is often mentioned in the ancient legends.[951]

In Greek legends and myths, we meet with several instances of fighting
or emulation for women. Pausanias tells us that Danaus established a
race for his daughters, and that “he that outran all the rest was to
have the first choice, and take her whom he most approved; he that was
next in order was to have the second choice, and so on to the last; and
those who had no suitors were ordered to wait till new ones came to
the course.”[952] According to Pindar, Antæus, father of a fair-haired
and greatly-praised daughter, who had many suitors, stationed the
whole company of them at the end of the race-course, saying that he
should have her for his bride who should prove foremost in the race and
first touch her garments.[953] Icarus likewise proposed a race for the
suitors of Penelope;[954] and, as Mr. Hamilton remarks, “the triumph
of Odysseus over the Suitors is the real end of the Odyssey.”[955]

According to Dr. Krauss, the South Slavonian youths on Palm Sunday,
the day for presentiments of love, wrestle with each other, believing
that he who proves the stronger will get the prettier wife.[956] Arthur
Young informs us of the following strange custom which prevailed in
the interior of Ireland in his time:—“There is a very ancient custom
here,” he says, “for a number of country neighbours among the poor
people to fix upon some young woman that ought, as they think, to be
married; they also agree upon a young fellow as a proper husband for
her; this determined, they send to the fair one’s cabin to inform her
that on the Sunday following ‘she is to be horsed,’ that is, carried
on men’s backs. She must then provide whisky and cider for a treat, as
all will pay her a visit after mass for a hurling match. As soon as
she is horsed the hurling begins, in which the young fellow appointed
for her husband has the eyes of all the company fixed on him: if he
comes off conqueror, he is certainly married to the girl; but if
another is victorious, he as certainly loses her, for she is the prize
of the victor.... Sometimes one barony hurls against another, but a
marriageable girl is always the prize.”[957]

       *       *       *       *       *

The sexual struggle in the animal kingdom is not always of a violent
kind. As Mr. Darwin has pointed out, males often try by peaceful
emulation to charm the female. In many species of birds the male seems
to endeavour to gain his bride by displaying his colours and ornaments
before her, or exciting her by his love-notes, songs, and antics. But
among the lower Mammals he wins her, apparently, much more through
the law of battle than through the display of his charms.[958] There
can scarcely be any doubt that the same was the case with primitive
men; but we need not mount many steps of human progress to find that
courtship involves something more than a mere act of strength or
courage on the part of the male. It is not only in civilized countries
that it often means a prolonged making of love to the woman. Mariner’s
words with reference to the women of Tonga hold true for a great many,
not to say all, savage and barbarous races now existing. “It must
not be supposed,” he says, “that these women are always easily won;
the greatest attentions and most fervent solicitations are sometimes
requisite, even though there be no other lover in the way. This happens
sometimes from a spirit of coquetry, at other times from a dislike to
the party, &c.”[959]

Though generally playing the less active part in courtship, the woman
does not by any means indulge in complete passivity. Mr. Hooper tells
us that, among the Indians at James’s Bay, “two young Indian women
were observed some years ago in violent conflict.... After a lengthened
and determined struggle the weakest succumbed to the superior prowess
of her fortunate adversary. It appeared that these girls were in love
with the same man, and had self-instituted this mode of deciding their
claims.”[960] Among the Wintun of California, according to Mr. Powers,
when any man other than a chief attempts to introduce into his wigwam a
second partner of his bosom, the two women dispute for the supremacy,
often in a desperate pitched battle with sharp stones; “they maul each
other’s faces with savage violence, and if one is knocked down her
friends assist her to regain her feet, and the brutal combat is renewed
until one or the other is driven from the wigwam.”[961] Peltier states
that, in the Australian tribe already referred to, the women, of whom
from two to five commonly belong to each man, fight among themselves
about him, “their weapons being heavy staves, with which they beat one
another about the head till the blood flows.”[962] In the Kingsmill
Islands, women sometimes, from jealousy, carry a small weapon, watching
an opportunity of making an attack upon their rivals, desperate
fights being the consequence;[963] and, among the Kamchadales also,
the females are said to have fought for the males.[964] But far more
commonly women try to secure men’s love by coquetry or the display of
their charms. Finally, whilst the men are generally the courters, the
women may in many, perhaps most cases, accept or refuse their proposals
at pleasure.

The next chapter will be devoted to an account of some of the most
common means by which the sexes endeavour, or formerly endeavoured,
to make themselves attractive to one another, and to stimulate each
other’s passions. Then we shall see how far woman has the liberty of
disposing of her own hand, and, at the same time, note cases in which
the man also, with regard to his marriage, has to submit to some
other’s will.




CHAPTER IX

MEANS OF ATTRACTION


The desire for self-decoration, although a specifically human quality,
is exceedingly old. There are peoples destitute of almost everything
which we regard as necessaries of life, but there is no people so
rude as not to take pleasure in ornaments. The ancient barbarians who
inhabited the south of Europe at the same time as the reindeer and the
mammoth, brought to their caves brilliant and ornamental objects.[965]
The women of the utterly wretched Veddahs in Ceylon decorate themselves
with necklaces of brass beads, and bangles cut from the chank
shell.[966] The Fuegians “are content to be naked,” but “ambitious
to be fine.”[967] The Australians, without taking the slightest pride
in their appearance, so far as neatness or cleanliness is concerned,
are yet very vain of their own rude decorations.[968] And of the rude
Tasmanians, Cook tells us that they had no wish to obtain useful
articles, but were eager to secure anything ornamental.

“Great as is the vanity of the civilized,” says Mr. Spencer, “it is
exceeded by that of the uncivilized.”[969] The predilection of savages
for ornaments has been sufficiently shown by travellers in almost
every part of the world. Feathers and beads of different colours,
flowers, rings, anklets, and bracelets, are common embellishments. A
fully-equipped Santal belle, for instance, carries two anklets, and
perhaps twelve bracelets, and a necklace weighing a pound, the total
weight of ornaments on her person amounting to thirty-four pounds of
bell metal,—“a greater weight,” says Captain Sherwill, “than one
of our drawing-room belles could well lift.”[970] Besides this, the
body is transformed in various ways. The lips, the sides of the nose,
and the lobes of the ear are especially ill-treated. Hardly any woman
in Eastern Central Africa is without a lip-ring; they say it makes
them look pretty, and “the bigger the ring, the more they value
themselves!”[971] The Shulis bore a hole in the underlip and insert in
it a piece of crystal three or four inches long, which sways about as
they speak;[972] and similar customs are common among other African
peoples,[973] as also in some parts of North and South America.[974]
The Papuans perforate the septum of the nose and insert in the hole
sticks, claws of birds, &c.[975] The most common practice is to pierce,
enlarge, or somehow mutilate the ear-lobes. Certain North American
Indians,[976] the Arecunas and Botocudos of South America,[977] and
the East African Wa-taïta[978] pull them down almost to the shoulders.
Among the Easter Islanders, says Beechey, “the lobe, deprived of its
ear-ring, hangs dangling against the neck, and has a very disagreeable
appearance, particularly when wet. It is sometimes so long as to be
greatly in the way; to obviate which, they pass the lobe over the upper
part of the ear, or more rarely, fasten one lobe to the other, at the
back of the head.”[979]

Scarcely less subject to mutilations are the teeth. In the Malay
Archipelago, the filing and blackening of the teeth are thought
to produce a most beautiful result, white teeth being in great
disesteem.[980] The Australians often knock out one or two front teeth
of the upper jaw, and several tribes in New Guinea file their teeth
sharp.[981] Again, the Damaras file the middle teeth in the upper jaw
into the form of a swallow’s tail, and knock out four teeth in the
lower jaw; whilst one of the Makalaka tribes, north of the Zambesi, and
the Matongas, on its bank, “break out their top incisor-teeth from the
sheerest vanity. Their women say that it is only horses that eat with
all their teeth, and that men ought not to eat like horses.”[982]

Many savage men take most pride in the hair of the head. Now it is
painted in a showy manner, now decorated with beads and tinsel, now
combed and arranged with the most exquisite care. The Kandhs have
their hair, which is worn very long, drawn forward and rolled up till
it looks like a horn projecting from between the eyes. Around this it
is their delight to wear a piece of red cloth, and they insert the
feathers of favourite birds, as also a pipe, comb, &c.[983] The men
of Tana, of the New Hebrides, wear their hair “twelve and eighteen
inches long, and have it divided into some six or seven hundred little
locks or tresses;”[984] and, among the Latúka, a man requires a period
of from eight to ten years to perfect his coiffure.[985] In North
America, Hearne saw several men about six feet high, who had preserved
“a single lock of their hair that, when let down, would trail on the
ground as they walked.”[986] Other Indians practise the custom of
shaving the head and ornamenting it with the crest of deer’s hairs; and
wigs are used by several savage peoples.[987] The Indians of Guiana,
the Fuegians, Chavantes, Uaupés,[988] and other tribes are in the habit
of pulling out their eyebrows.

Scarcely anything has a greater attraction for the savage mind than
showy colours. “No matter,” says Dr. Holub, “how ill a traveller in
the Marutse district may be, and how many bearers he may require, if he
only has a good stock of blue beads he may always be sure of commanding
the best attention and of securing the amplest services; his beads will
prove an attraction irresistible to sovereign and subject, to man,
woman, and child, to freeman and bondman alike.”[989] The practice of
ornamenting one’s self with gaudy baubles and painting the body with
conspicuous colours is, indeed, extremely prevalent. Of Santal men at
a feast, Sir W. Hunter says that, “if all the colours of the rainbow
were not displayed by them, certainly the hedgehog, the peacock, and
a variety of the feathered tribe had been laid under contribution in
order to supply the young Santal beaux with plumes.”[990] Especially
does the savage man delight in paint. Red ochre is generally looked
upon as the chief embellishment, whilst, of the other colours, black
and white are probably most in use. The Naudowessies paint their faces
red and black, “which they esteem as greatly ornamental.”[991] Among
the Guaycurûs, many men paint their bodies half red, half white.[992]
Throughout the Australian continent the natives stain themselves with
black, red, yellow, and white.[993] In Fiji, a small quantity of
vermilion is esteemed “as the greatest possible acquisition.”[994] In
New Zealand, the lips of both sexes are generally dyed blue; and in
Santa Cruz, or Egmont Island, Labillardière observed with surprise that
“there was very much diffused a fondness for white hair, which formed
a striking contrast to the colour of their skin.”[995]

“Not one great country can be named,” Mr. Darwin says, “from the
Polar regions in the north to New Zealand in the south, in which the
aborigines do not tattoo themselves.”[996] This practice was followed
by the ancient Assyrians, Britons, and Thracians,[997] as it is
followed by most savages still. And it may be said without exaggeration
that there is no visible part of the human body, except the eyeball,
that has escaped from being disfigured in this way. Some of the Easter
Islanders tattoo their foreheads in arched lines, as also the edges
of their ears, and the fleshy part of their lips.[998] The Abyssinian
women occasionally prick their gums entirely blue.[999] The Mundrucûs
tattooed even their eyelids.[1000] And, speaking of the tattooing of
the Sandwich Islanders, Freycinet remarks, “Aucune partie de leur
corps n’en est exempte; le nez, les oreilles, les paupières, le sommet
de la tête, le bout de la langue même dans quelques circonstances, en
sont surchargés non moins que la poitrine, le dos, les jambes, les bras
et la paume des mains.”[1001]

Often cicatrices are made in the skin, without any colouring matter
being used. Some tribes of Madagascar, for instance, are in the habit
of making marks, “which are intended to be ornamental,” by slight
incisions in the skin.[1002] The natives of Tana ornament themselves
by “cutting or burning some rude device of a leaf or a fish on the
breast, or upper part of the arm.”[1003] The Australians throughout the
continent scar their persons, as Mr. Curr assures us, only as a means
of decoration.[1004] And, in Fiji, “rows of wart-like spots are burned
along the arms and backs of the women, which they and their admirers
call ornamental.”[1005]

It has been suggested that many of these practices sprang from other
motives than a desire for decoration; and some are said to have had
a religious origin. The Australian Dieyerie, on being asked why he
knocks out two front teeth of the upper jaw of his children, can answer
only that, when they were created, the Muramura, a good spirit, thus
disfigured the first child, and, pleased at the sight, commanded
that the like should be done to every male or female child for ever
after.[1006] The Pelew Islanders believe that the perforation of the
septum of the nose is necessary for winning eternal bliss;[1007] and
the Nicaraguans say that their ancestors were instructed by the gods
to flatten the children’s heads.[1008] Again, in Fiji, it is supposed
that the custom of tattooing is in conformity with the appointment of
the god Dengei, and that its neglect is punished after death.[1009] A
similar idea prevails among the Kingsmill Islanders and Ainos;[1010]
and the Greenlanders formerly believed that the heads of those girls
who had not been deformed by long stitches made with a needle and black
thread between the eyes, on the forehead, and upon the chin, would be
turned into train tubs, and placed under the lamps in heaven, in the
land of souls.[1011] But such tales are not of much importance, as any
usage practised from time immemorial may easily be ascribed to the
command of a god.

Mr. Frazer suggests that several of the practices here mentioned are
fundamentally connected with totemism.[1012] In order to put himself
more fully under the protection of the totem, the clansman, according
to Mr. Frazer, is in the habit of assimilating himself to it by
the arrangement of his hair and the mutilation of his body; and of
representing the totem on his body by cicatrices, tattooing, or paint.
Thus the Buffalo clans of the Iowa and Omahas wear two locks of hair in
imitation of horns; whilst the Small Bird clan of the Omahas “leave
a little hair in front, over the forehead, for a bill, and some at the
back of the head, for the bird’s tail, with much over each ear for the
wings;” and the Turtle subclan cut off all the hair from a boy’s head,
except six locks which are arranged so as to imitate the legs, head,
and tail of a turtle. The practice of knocking out the upper front
teeth at puberty, Mr. Frazer continues, is, or was once, probably an
imitation of the totem; and so also the bone, reed, or stick which
some Australian tribes thrust through the nose. The Haidahs of Queen
Charlotte Islands have always, and the Iroquois commonly, their totems
tattooed on their persons, and certain other tribes have on their
bodies tattooed figures of animals, which Mr. Frazer thinks likely to
be totem marks. According to one authority, the raised cicatrices of
the Australians are sometimes arranged in patterns representing the
totem; and, among a few peoples, the totem is painted on the person of
the clansman.[1013]

Mr. Frazer’s theory is supported by exceedingly few facts whereas
there is an enormous mass of cases in which we have no right whatever
to infer a connection with totemism. It is, indeed, impossible to
see how most of the practices considered in this chapter could have
originated in this way. How is it possible to explain the knocking
out of the upper front teeth or the thrusting of a stick through the
nose as imitations of totem animals? And how are we to connect the
mutilations of the ears and other parts of the body, and the various
modes of self-decoration, with totemism? Since all such practices are
universally considered to improve the appearance, and, as will be shown
presently, take place at the same period of life, we may justly infer
that the cause to which they owe their origin is fundamentally one and
the same. As for tattooing, Professor Gerland assumes that the tattooed
marks were originally figures of totem animals, though they are no
longer so;[1014] but an assumption of that kind is not permissible
in a scientific investigation. And even in those rare cases, where
a connection between tattooing and totemism undoubtedly exists, we
cannot be sure whether this connection is not secondary. At present
tattooing is everywhere regarded exclusively, or almost exclusively, as
a means of decoration, and Cook states expressly that, in the South
Sea Islands, at the time of their discovery, it was in no way connected
with religion.[1015] Nor can I agree with Mr. Spencer that tattooing
and other kinds of mutilation were practised originally as a means
of expressing subordination to a dead ruler or a god.[1016] Equally
without evidence is Mr. Colquhoun’s opinion that the custom originated
in the wish either to make a man more fearful in battle, or to render
the body invulnerable by the tattooing of charms on it.[1017]

It is true, no doubt, that this practice subserves various ends. Mr.
Keyser speaks of a chief in New Guinea who had sixty-three blue tattoo
lines on his chest, which represented the number of enemies he had
slain.[1018] Moreover, the tattooed marks make it possible for savages
to distinguish their own clansmen from their enemies;[1019] though
I cannot think, with Chenier,[1020] that this was their original
object. Again, many ornaments are really nothing but trophy-badges,
and many things used for ornaments were at first substitutes for
trophies, having some resemblance to them;[1021] whilst others are
carried as signs of opulence.[1022] I do not deny, either, that men
may sometimes paint their bodies in order to inspire their enemies
with fear in battle, or that the use of red ochre and fat is good as
a defence against changes of weather, flies, and mosquitoes.[1023]
Nevertheless, it seems to be beyond doubt that men and women began to
ornament, mutilate, paint, and tattoo themselves chiefly in order to
make themselves attractive to the opposite sex,—that they might court
successfully, or be courted.

It is noteworthy that in all parts of the world the desire for
self-decoration is strongest at the beginning of the age of puberty,
all the above-named customs being practised most zealously at that
period of life. Concerning the Dacotahs, Mr. Prescott states that both
sexes adorn themselves at their courtships to make themselves more
attractive, and that “the young only are addicted to dress.”[1024] The
Oráon, according to Colonel Dalton, is likewise particular about his
personal appearance “only so long as he is unmarried.”[1025] Among the
Let-htas in Indo-China, it is the unmarried youths that are profusely
bedecked with red and white bead necklaces, wild boars’ tusks, brass
armlets, and a broad band of black braid below the knee.[1026] Speaking
of the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia, the Rev. A. Meyer says
that “the plucking out of the beard and anointing with grease and
ochre (which belong to the initiatory ceremony) the men may continue
if they please till about forty years of age, for they consider it
ornamental, and fancy that it makes them look younger, and gives
them an importance in the eyes of the women.”[1027] In Fiji, says
Mr. Anderson, the men, “who like to attract the attention of the
opposite sex, don their best plumage;”[1028] and when Mr. Bulmer once
asked an Australian native why he wore his adornments, the native
answered “that he wore them in order to look well, and to make himself
agreeable to the women.”[1029]

It is when boys or girls approach puberty that, in the north-west
part of North America, they have their lower lip perforated for the
labret;[1030] that, among the American Eskimo, the African Masarwas,
and certain Australian natives, the cartilage between the nostrils is
pierced for the reception of a piece of bone, wood, or shell.[1031] At
the same age, among the Chibchas and the aborigines of the Californian
Peninsula, holes were made in the ears.[1032] It is at this period of
life, also, that the Chaymas of New Andalusia, the Pelew Islanders, and
the natives of New Britain have their teeth blackened, as black teeth,
both for men and women, are considered an indispensable condition of
beauty;[1033] and that, in several parts of Africa and Australia, they
knock out some teeth, knowing that otherwise they would run the risk
of being refused on account of ugliness.[1034] Among the Nicobarese,
among whom the men blacken their teeth from the period of puberty,
this disfigurement is indeed so favourably regarded by the fair sex
that a woman “would scorn to accept the addresses of one possessing
white teeth, like a dog or pig.”[1035] Mr. Crawfurd tells us that,
in the Malay Archipelago, the practice of filing and blackening the
teeth, already referred to, is a necessary prelude to marriage, the
common way of expressing the fact that a girl has arrived at puberty
being that “she has had her teeth filed.”[1036] And, with reference
to some of the natives of the Congo countries, Tuckey states that the
two upper front teeth are filed by the men, so as to make a large
opening, and scars are raised on the skin, both being intended by the
men as ornamental, and “principally done with the idea of rendering
themselves agreeable to the women.”[1037]

The important part played by the hair of the head as a stimulant of
sexual passion appears in a curious way from Mr. Sibree’s account of
King Radàma’s attempt to introduce European customs among the Hovas
of Madagascar. As soon as he had adopted the military tactics of the
English, he ordered that all his officers and soldiers should have
their hair cut; but this command produced so great a disturbance among
the women of the capital that they assembled in great numbers to
protest against the king’s order, and could not be quieted till they
were surrounded by troops and their leaders cruelly speared.[1038]
Everywhere it is the young and unmarried people who are most anxious
to dress their hair.[1039] Thus, among the Bunjogees, a Chittagong
Hill tribe, the young men “stuff a large ball of black cotton into
their topknot to make it look bigger.”[1040] In the Tenimber Group,
the lads decorate their long locks with leaves, flowers, and feathers,
as Riedel says, “only in order to please the women.”[1041] Among the
Tacullies, “the elderly people neglect to ornament their heads, in
the same manner as they do the rest of their persons, and generally
wear their hair short. But the younger people of both sexes, who feel
more solicitous to make themselves agreeable to each other, wash and
paint their faces and let their hair grow long.”[1042] And in the
Admiralty Islands, according to Professor Moseley, “only the young men
of apparently from eighteen to thirty, or so, wear the hair long and
combed out into a mop or bush,” whilst the boys or older men wear the
hair short.[1043]

Passing to the practice of painting the body: Dr. Sparrman tells us
that the two Hottentots whom he had in his service, when they expected
to meet some girls of their own nation, painted their noses, cheeks,
and the middle of the forehead with soot.[1044] On Flinders Island,
whither the remnant of the Tasmanians were removed, a rebellion nearly
burst out when orders were once issued forbidding the use of ochre
and grease, for “the young men feared the loss of favour in the eyes
of their countrywomen.”[1045] Among the Guarayos, the suitor, when
courting, keeps for some days close to the cabin of the mistress of
his heart, he being painted from head to foot, and armed with his
battle club.[1046] In certain parts of Australia, when a boy arrives
at the age of puberty, his hair, body, and limbs are profusely smeared
with red ochre and fat, this being one of the rites by which he is
initiated into the privileges of manhood.[1047] Again, with reference
to the Ahts, Mr. Sproat remarks that “some of the young men streak
their faces with red, but grown-up men seldom now use paint, unless
on particular occasions.” The women cease to use it about the age of
twenty-five.[1048]

The girls are generally painted when they arrive at the epoch of the
first menstruation.[1049] Thus, among certain Equatorial Africans,
they are rubbed with black, red, and white paints in the course of a
ceremony which, according to Mr. Reade, is essentially of a Phallic
nature.[1050] If a young maiden of the Tapoyers of Brazil “be
marriageable, and yet not courted by any, the mother paints her with
some red colour about the eyes.”[1051]

The act of tattooing, also, generally takes place at the age of
puberty, in the case of men as well as in that of women. It is about
that period that, in the underlip of all freeborn female Thlinkets,
“a slit is made parallel with the mouth, and about half an inch
below it;”[1052] that, among the Eskimo, pigments of various dye are
pricked on the chin, at the angles of the mouth, and across the face
over the cheek-bones;[1053] that, in some South American tribes,
incisions are made from the shoulders of the girl to her waist, “when
she is regarded as a delicious morsel for the arms of an ardent
lover.”[1054] At the same age, either or both sexes are subject to
tattooing among the Guarayos,[1055] Abipones,[1056] Baris,[1057]
Gonds,[1058] Dyaks,[1059] Negritos of the Philippines,[1060] South
Sea Islanders,[1061] Australians,[1062] &c. Among the Nagas of Upper
Assam, it was the custom “to allow matrimony to those only who made
themselves as hideous as possible by having their faces elaborately
tattooed.”[1063] The Makalaka girls, before they could marry, had to
submit to horrible torture, about four thousand stitches being made
in the skin of the chest and stomach, and a black fluid being rubbed
into the wounds.[1064] In New Zealand, according to the Rev. R. Taylor,
it was the great ambition of the young to have fine tattooed faces,
“both to render themselves attractive to the ladies, and conspicuous
in war.”[1065] In Samoa, until a young man was tattooed, he could not
think of marriage, but as soon as this was done, he considered himself
entitled to all the privileges of mature years.[1066] “When it is
all over,” says Mr. Pritchard, “and the youths thoroughly healed, a
grand dance is got up on the first available pretext to display the
tattooing, when the admiration of the fair sex is unsparingly bestowed.
And this is the great reward, long and anxiously looked forward to by
the youths as they smart under the hands of the ‘matai.’”[1067] Often,
however, the operation is accomplished not at once, but at different
times, that the patients may be able to bear the inflammation and pain
at every stage of the process; and not unfrequently it begins when the
girls are quite young children, being constantly added to until they
marry.[1068]

The real object of the custom is shown also by several other
statements. When Mertens asked the natives of Lukunor what was the
meaning of tattooing, one of them answered, “It has the same object
as your clothes, that is, to please the women.”[1069] Bancroft
remarks that young Kadiak wives “secure the affectionate admiration
of their husbands by tattooing the breast and adorning the face with
black lines.”[1070] The raised cuts of the Australians, according to
Mr. Palmer, are “merely ornamental and convey no idea of tribal
connection,” the women marking themselves in this manner “to add to
their looks, and to make themselves attractive.”[1071] Barrington
assures us that, among the natives of Botany Bay, “scars are, by
both sexes, deemed highly ornamental;”[1072] and, in the Eucla tribe,
according to Mr. W. Williams, both sexes make horizontal scars on
the chest and vertical scars on the upper arm “for the purpose of
ornamentation.”[1073] In Ponapé, as we are informed by von Kubary
and Finsch, tattooing is practised only as a means of improving the
appearance;[1074] and, in New Guinea, the women tattoo themselves “to
please the men.”[1075] Bock remarks, “As the Dyak women are tattooed
to please their lovers, so the Laos men undergo the ordeal for the sake
of the women.”[1076]

In Samoa, great licentiousness was connected with the custom of
tattooing; and, in Tahiti, the chiefs prohibited it altogether on
account of the obscene practices by which it was invariably accompanied
in that island.[1077] The Tahitians have also a very characteristic
tale of its origin. Taaroa, their god, and Apouvaru had a daughter, who
was called Hinaeree-remonoi. “As she grew up, in order to preserve
her chastity, she was made ‘pahio,’ or kept in a kind of enclosure,
and constantly attended by her mother. Intent on her seduction, the
brothers invented tattooing, and marked each other with the figure
called Taomaro. Thus ornamented, they appeared before their sister,
who admired the figures, and, in order to be tattooed herself, eluding
the care of her mother, broke the enclosure that had been erected for
her preservation, was tattooed, and became also the victim to the
designs of her brothers. Tattooing thus originated among the gods,
and was first practised by the children of Taaroa, their principal
deity. In imitation of their example, and for the accomplishment of the
same purposes, it was practised among men.... The two sons of Taaroa
and Apouvaru were the gods of tattooing. Their images were kept in
the temples of those who practised the art professionally, and every
application of their skill was preceded by a prayer addressed to them,
that the operation might not occasion death, that the wounds might soon
heal, that the figures might be handsome, attract admirers, and answer
the ends of wickedness designed.”[1078]

This legend is especially instructive because it shows how a custom
which had originally nothing to do with religion may in time take a
more or less religious character. Professor Wundt holds that, in most
cases, religious ideas are the original sources from which customs
flow;[1079] but it is far more probable that the connection between
religion and custom is often secondary. Nearly every practice which for
some reason or other has come into fashion and taken root among the
people, is readily supposed to have a divine sanction; and this is one
of the reasons why conservatism as to religion is so often accompanied
by conservatism in other matters. This must especially be the case
among savage men who identify their ancestors with their gods, and
consequently look upon ancient customs as divine institutions.

It is, indeed, difficult to believe that the motives which gave rise to
tattooing can have been different from those which led to the painting
of the body. The chief distinction between the two is, that the
tattooed marks are indelible, being neither extinguished nor rendered
fainter by lapse of time. Hence the prevalence of tattooing may be
explained by a general desire among savages to make the decorations of
the body permanent. Sometimes, too, the custom seems to be kept up as a
test of courage.[1080]

Even to European tastes the incised lines and figures have in many
cases a certain beauty. Thus, speaking of the Gambier Islanders,
Beechey assures us that the tattooing undoubtedly improves their
appearance; and Yate remarks that “nothing can exceed the beautiful
regularity with which the faces and thighs of the New Zealanders are
tattooed,” the volutes being perfect specimens, and the regularity
mechanically correct.[1081] Forster observed that, among the natives
of Waitahoo (Marquesas Islands), the punctures were disposed with the
utmost care, so that the marks on each leg, arm, and cheek and on the
corresponding muscles were exactly similar.[1082] Among the Tahitians,
according to Darwin, the ornaments follow the curvature of the body so
gracefully, that they have a very pleasing and elegant effect; and,
among the Easter Islanders, “all the lines were drawn with much taste,
and carried in the direction of the muscle.”[1083] The fact that the
tattooed lines follow closely the natural forms of the body in order to
render them more conspicuous, has been observed in the case of other
peoples also,[1084] and it would be ridiculous to regard such marks as
transformed images of gods.

The facts stated seem to show that the object of tattooing,[1085]
as well as of other kinds of self-decoration or mutilation, was to
stimulate the sexual desire of the opposite sex. To us it appears
strange that such repugnant practices as that of perforating the septum
of the nose or removing teeth should owe their origin to coquetry, but
we must not judge of the taste of savages by our own. In this case the
desire for self-decoration is to a great extent identical with the wish
to attract attention, to excite by means of the charm of novelty.[1086]
At all stages of civilization people like a slight variety, but
deviations from what they are accustomed to see must not be too great,
nor of such a kind as to provoke a disagreeable association of ideas.
In Cochin China, where the women blacken their teeth, a man said of
the wife of the English Ambassador contemptuously that “she had
white teeth like a dog;”[1087] and the Abipones in South America, who
carefully plucked out all the hairs with which our eyes are naturally
protected, despised the Europeans for their thick eyebrows, and called
them brothers to the ostriches, who have very thick brows.[1088] We, on
the other hand, would dislike to see a woman with a crystal or a piece
of wood in her lip.

It is a common notion that women are by nature vainer and more addicted
to dressing and decorating themselves than men. This certainly does
not hold good for savage and barbarous peoples in general. It is true
that, among many of them, tattooing is exclusively or predominantly
limited to the women, and that the men sometimes wear fewer ornaments.
But several travellers, as for instance Dr. Schweinfurth[1089] and
Dr. Barth,[1090] who have a vast experience of African races, agree
that the reverse is usually the case. The women of all the tribes of
Indians Richardson saw on his route through the northern parts of the
fur countries, adorned their persons less than the men of the same
tribes; and the like is said of the Comanches.[1091] Among the Uaupés,
Mr. Wallace observed “that the men and boys appropriated all the
ornaments.”[1092] The native women of Orangerie Bay of New Guinea,
except that they are tattooed, adorn themselves less than the men,
and none of them paint their faces and bodies, as the men frequently
do.[1093] In the Admiralty Islands, young girls “sometimes have a
necklace or two on, but they never are decorated to the extent to which
the men are,” it being evidently not considered good taste for them to
adorn their persons.[1094] Among the aborigines of the New Hebrides,
New Hanover, New Ireland,[1095] and Australia,[1096] adornments are
almost entirely monopolised by the men, the “fair sex” being content
with their natural charms.

It has been suggested that the plainer appearance of the women
depends upon their oppressed and despised position, as well as upon
the selfishness of the men.[1097] But it is doubtful whether this is
the true explanation. Savage ornaments, generally speaking, are not
costly things, and even where the state of women is most degraded
a woman may, if she pleases, paint her body with red ochre or put
a piece of wood through her lip or a feather through the cartilage
of the nose. In Eastern Central Africa, for instance, the women are
more decorated than the men, although they hold an inferior position,
being viewed as beasts of burden, and doing all the harder work. “A
woman,” says Mr. Macdonald, “always kneels when she has occasion to
talk to a man.”[1098] Almost the same is said of the female Indians of
Guiana;[1099] whereas in the Yule Island, on the Coast of New Guinea,
and in New Hanover, the women are less given to personal adornment
than the men, although they are held in respect, have influence in
their families, and exercise, in some villages, much authority, or even
supremacy.[1100]

Of all the various kinds of self-ornamentation tattooing is the most
laborious. Yet, in Melanesia, it is chiefly women that are tattooed,
though they are treated as slaves; whilst in Polynesia, where the
_status_ of women is comparatively good, this practice is mainly
confined to the men.[1101] In Fiji, where women were fearfully
oppressed, genuine tattooing was found on them only.[1102]

It is expressly stated of the women of several savage peoples that
they are less desirous of self-decoration than the men. Speaking of
the Aleuts on the Fur-Seal Islands of Alaska, Mr. Elliott says, “In
these lower races there is much more vanity displayed by the masculine
element than the feminine, according to my observation; in other words,
I have noticed a greater desire among the young men than among the
young women of savage and semi-civilised people to be gaily dressed,
and to look fine.”[1103] Among the Gambier Islanders, according to
Beechey, the women “have no ornaments of any kind, and appeared quite
indifferent to the beads and trinkets which were offered them.”[1104]
In Tierra del Fuego, Lieutenant Bove found the men more desirous of
ornaments than the women; and Proyart made a similar observation with
regard to the people of Loango.[1105] Again, touching the Crees,
Mackenzie remarks that “the women, though by no means inattentive to
the decoration of their own persons, appear to have a still greater
degree of pride attending to the appearance of the men, whose faces are
painted with more care than those of the women.”[1106]

It is difficult, then, to believe that the inferior position of the
weaker sex accounts for the comparative scarcity of female ornaments.
The fact may to some extent be explained by Mr. Spencer’s suggestion,
that ornaments have partly originated from trophy-badges, and Professor
Wundt’s, that they indicate rank and fortune: but these explanations
apply only to a few cases. If it be true that man began to decorate
himself chiefly in order to stimulate the passions of the opposite sex,
we may conclude that the vanity of the men is, in the first place,
due to the likings of the women, and that the plainer appearance
of the women is a consequence of the men’s greater indifference to
their ornaments. Mr. Darwin has shown that, among our domesticated
quadrupeds, individual antipathies and preferences are exhibited much
more commonly by the female than by the male,[1107] and the same, as
we shall see, is in some measure the case with man also. It is the
women rather than the men that have to be courted. Thus, with reference
to the natives of Gippsland, Mr. Brough Smyth, on the authority of
Mr. Bulmer, states, “The ornaments worn by the females were not much
regarded by the men. The woman did little to improve her appearance;
... if her physical aspect was such as to attract admirers she was
content.”[1108]

It should also be noted that among savages it is, as a rule, the man
only that runs the risk of being obliged to lead a single life. Hence
it is obvious that to the best of his ability he must endeavour to
be taken into favour by making himself as attractive as possible. In
civilized Europe, on the other hand, the opposite occurs. Here it is
the woman that has the greatest difficulty in getting married—and she
is also the vainer of the two.

The hypothesis as to the origin of the customs in question, set forth
in this chapter, presupposes of course that savage girls enjoy great
liberty in the choice of a mate. It will be seen subsequently that
there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of that presumption.

At a higher stage of civilization the tendency of mankind is to give
up savage ornaments, and no longer to regard mutilations of the body
as improving the appearance. In Persia, women still wear the nose-ring
through one side of the nostril,[1109] but to a European such a custom
would be extremely displeasing. In the Western world the ear-ring is
the last vanishing relic of savage taste.

       *       *       *       *       *

From the naked body the ornaments were transferred to clothing, partly
because climate made clothes necessary, partly for another reason. “A
savage begins,” Professor Moseley says, “by painting or tattooing
himself for ornament. Then he adopts a movable appendage, which he
hangs on his body, and on which he puts the ornamentation which he
formerly marked more or less indelibly on his skin. In this way he is
able to gratify _his taste for change_.”[1110]

It is usually said that man began to cover his body for two reasons:
first, to protect himself from frost and damp; secondly, on account of
a feeling of shame.

There can be no doubt that, when man emigrated from his warm native
home and settled down in less hospitable zones, it became necessary for
him to screen himself from the influences of a raw climate. The Eskimo
wrap themselves up in furs, and the wretched natives of Tierra del
Fuego throw a piece of sealskin over one of their shoulders, “on the
side from which the wind blows.”[1111]

The second motive, too, seems acceptable at first sight. The savage men
of the tropics, though otherwise entirely naked, commonly wear a scanty
dress which Europeans might readily suppose to be used for the sake
of decency. Nothing of the sort is found in any other animal species;
hence Professor Wundt concludes that shame is “a feeling specifically
peculiar to man.”[1112]

But why should man blush to expose one part of the body more than
another? This is no matter of course, but a problem to be solved.

The feeling in question cannot be regarded as originally innate in
mankind. There are many peoples, who, though devoid of any kind of
dress, show no trace of shame, and others who, when they dress
themselves, pay not the least regard to what we consider the first
requirements of decency.

Thus, in the northern parts of the Californian Peninsula, both men and
women have been found in a state of nudity.[1113] Among the Miwok,
according to their own confession, persons of both sexes and of all
ages were formerly absolutely naked.[1114] Lyman found the same to be
the case with the Paiuches in northern Colorado, Columbus with the
aborigines of Hispaniola, Pizarro with the Indians of Coca, v. Humboldt
with the Chaymas, Wallace with the Purupurús, v. Schütz-Holzhausen with
the Catamixis, Prince Maximilian with the Puris at St. Fidelis, Azara
with certain Indians in the neighbourhood of the river Paraguay.[1115]
In some Indian tribes the men alone go naked,[1116] in others the
women.[1117] Again, in North America, Mackenzie met a troop of
natives, of whom the men wore many ornaments and much clothing, but
had, apparently, not the slightest notion of bashfulness. And of the
Fuegians we are told that, although they have the shoulder or the back
protected by a sealskin, the rest of the body is perfectly naked.[1118]

The men of most Australian tribes, and in many cases the women, wear
no clothes except in cold weather, when they throw a kangaroo skin
about their shoulders. “They are as innocent of shame,” says Mr.
Palmer, “as the animals of the forests.”[1119] In Tasmania, too,
the aborigines were usually naked, or, when they covered themselves,
they showed that the idea of decency had not occurred to them.[1120]
The same is said of some tribes in Borneo[1121] and Sumatra,[1122]
the people of Jarai, bordering upon the empire of Siam,[1123] the
inhabitants of the Louisiade Archipelago,[1124] Solomon Islands,[1125]
Penrhyn Island, and some other islands of the South Sea;[1126] whilst,
in others, only the men generally go naked.[1127] The Papuans of the
south-west coast of New Guinea “glory in their nudeness, and consider
clothing to be fit only for women.”[1128] In one part of Timor, on the
other hand,[1129] as also in a tribe of the Andamanese,[1130] it is the
women that are devoid of any kind of covering.

Passing to Africa, we meet with instances of the same kind. Concerning
the Wa-taveita of the eastern equatorial region, Mr. Johnston remarks
that “both sexes have little notion or conception of decency, the men
especially seeming to be unconscious of any impropriety in nakedness.
What clothing they have is worn as an adornment or for warmth at night
and early morning.”[1131] The Wa-chaga and Mashukulumbe generally go
about naked,[1132] and so do the Bushmans, except when they use a
piece of skin barely sufficient to cover the back.[1133] Again, among
the Bubis of Fernando Po[1134] and the natives of Balonda[1135] and
Loango,[1136] the women have no sort of covering, whilst, among the
Negroes of the Egyptian Soudan,[1137] the Baris,[1138] Shilluk,[1139]
Dinka,[1140] Watuta,[1141] and Masai,[1142] this is the case with
the men only. Apud Masaios membrum virile celare turpe existimatur,
honestum expromere, atque etiam ostentare.[1143] In Lancerote also,
according to Bontier and Le Verrier, the men used no covering; and,
in Teneriffe, “the inhabitants went naked, except some few who wore
goatskins.”[1144]

It might perhaps be supposed that the feeling of modesty, though
not originally innate, appeared later on, at a certain stage of
civilization, either spontaneously or from some unknown cause. This
seems, indeed, to be the opinion of Professor Wundt, who says that man
began to cover himself from decency.[1145] But let us see what covering
savages often use.

A fashionable young Wintun woman, says Mr. Powers, wears a girdle of
deer-skin, the lower edge of which is slit into a long fringe with a
polished pine-nut at the end of each strand, while the upper border
and other portions are studded with brilliant bits of shell.[1146] The
Botocudos use a covering which has little resemblance to a garment; and
their neighbours, the Patachos and Machacaris, make this trifle still
smaller, a thread being sufficient clothing, according to their notion
of modesty.[1147] When a Carib girl attained the age of ten or twelve
years, she assumed around the waist “a piece of cotton cloth worked
and embroidered with minute grains of shells of different colours,
decorated in the lower part with fringe.”[1148] Similar ornamental
skirts are in use among the Macusís, Arawaks, and other South American
peoples.[1149] Among the Guaycurûs, the men had no covering, except
a narrow bandage round the loins, which was of coloured cotton, and
often adorned with glass beads.[1150] The Australians of Port Essington
occasionally wear girdles of finely twisted human hair, and the men
sometimes add a tassel of the hair of the opossum or flying squirrel,
suspended in front.[1151] The women on the Lower Murray manufacture
round mats of grass or reeds, which they fasten upon their backs,
“tying them in front, so that they almost resemble the shell of a
tortoise.”[1152] In Tahiti, a “maro,” composed of red and yellow
feathers, was considered a present of very great value, and the women
thought it “most ornamental” to enfold their loins with many windings
of cloth.[1153] Dr. Seemann states that, in Fiji, the girls “wore
nothing save a girdle of hibiscus-fibres, about six inches wide, dyed
black, red, yellow, white, or brown, and put on in such a coquettish
way, that one thought it must come off every moment.”[1154] A similar
practice is common in the islands of the Pacific, fringes made of
cocoa-nut fibre or of leaves slit into narrow strips or filaments of
bark, frequently dyed with gaudy colours, being, in most of these
islands, the only garment of the natives. This costume, with its
conspicuous tint and mobile fringe, has a most graceful appearance and
a very pretty effect, but is far from being in harmony with our ideas
of modesty. In the island of Yap, according to Cheyne, “the dress of
the males, if such it may be called, is slovenly in the extreme. They
wear the ‘maro’ next them, and, by way of improvement, a bunch of bark
fibres dyed red, over it.”[1155] In New Caledonia, in Forster’s time,
the natives only tied “a string round the middle and another round
the neck;”[1156] whilst, in some other groups, the costume of the men
consisted of nothing but a leaf,[1157] a mussel,[1158] or a shell.[1159]

In Sumatra, according to Marsden, young women, before they are of an
age to be clothed, have a plate of silver in the shape of a heart
hung in front by a chain of the same metal.[1160] Among the Garos of
Bengal, the women wear merely a very short piece of striped blue cotton
round the waist. The men have a very narrow waist-cloth tied behind
and then brought up between the legs; the portion hanging over in
front is sometimes adorned with brass boss-like ornaments, and white
long-shaped beads.[1161] In Lukungu, the entire covering of most of the
women consists of a narrow string with some white china beads threaded
on it.[1162] The Hottentot women, according to Barrow, bestowed their
largest and most splendid ornaments upon the little apron, about
seven or eight inches wide, that hung from the waist. “Great pains,”
he says, “seem to be taken by the women to attract notice towards
this part of their persons. Large metal buttons, shells of the cypræa
genus, with the apertures outwards, or anything that makes a great
show, are fastened to the borders of this apron.”[1163] The Bushman
women of South Africa, met with by the same traveller, had as their
only covering a belt of springbok’s skin, the part which was intended
to hang in front being cut into long threads. But the filaments, he
says, “were so small and thin that they answered no sort of use as
a covering; nor, indeed, did the females, either old or young, seem
to feel any sense of shame in appearing before us naked.”[1164] And
among the Negroes of Benin, according to Bosman, the girls had no other
garment than some strings of coral twisted about the middle.[1165]

It seems utterly improbable that such “garments” owe their origin to
the feeling of shame. Their ornamental character being obvious, there
can be but little doubt that men and women originally, at least in
many cases, covered themselves not from modesty, but on the contrary,
in order to make themselves more attractive—the men to women, and the
women to men.

In a state where all go perfectly nude, nakedness must appear quite
natural, for what we see day after day makes no special impression
upon us. But when one or another—whether man or woman—began to put on
a bright-coloured fringe, some gaudy feathers, a string with beads, a
bundle of leaves, a piece of cloth, or a dazzling shell, this could not
of course escape the attention of the others; and the scanty covering
was found to act as the most powerful attainable sexual stimulus.[1166]
Hence the popularity of such garments in the savage world.

Several travellers have noticed that there is nothing indecent in
absolute nakedness when the eyes have got accustomed to it. “Where all
men go naked, as for instance in New Holland,” says Forster, “custom
familiarizes them to each other’s eyes, as much as if they went wholly
muffled up in garments.”[1167] Speaking of a Port Jackson woman who was
entirely uncovered, Captain Hunter remarks, “There is such an air of
innocence about her that clothing scarcely appears necessary.”[1168]
With reference to the Uupés, Mr. Wallace records his opinion that
“there is far more immodesty in the transparent and flesh-coloured
garments of our stage-dancers, than in the perfect nudity of these
daughters of the forest.”[1169] In his ‘Africa Unveiled’ Mr. Rowley
remarks, “When the sight becomes accustomed to the absence of raiment,
your sense of propriety is far less offended than in England, where
ample clothing is made the vehicle for asserting defiance, if not of
actual law, yet of the wishes and feelings of the more virtuous part
of the community.”[1170] And, speaking of the Fuegians, Captain Snow
says, “More harm, I think, is done by false modesty,—by covering and
_partly_ clothing, than by the truth in nature always appearing as it
is. Intermingling with savages of wild lands who do not clothe, gives
one, I believe, less impure and sensual feelings than the merely mixing
with society of a higher kind.”[1171]

The same view is taken by Dr. Zimmermann,[1172] and by Mr. Reade, who,
with reference to the natives of Central Africa, remarks that there
is nothing voluptuous in the excessive _déshabillé_ of an equatorial
girl, nothing being so moral and so unlikely to excite the passions
as nakedness.[1173] Speaking of the Wa-chaga, Mr. Johnston observes,
“We should be apt to call, from our point of view, their nakedness
and almost unconsciousness of shame indelicate, but it is rather, when
one gets used to it, a pleasing survival of the old innocent days when
prurient thoughts were absent from the mind of man.”[1174] As a careful
observer remarks,[1175] true modesty lies in the entire absence of
thought upon the subject. Among medical students and artists the nude
causes no extraordinary emotion; indeed, Flaxman asserted that the
students in entering the academy seem to hang up their passions along
with their hats.

On the other hand, Forster says of the natives of Mallicollo, that “it
is uncertain whether the scanty dress of their women owes its origin to
a sense of shame, or to an artful endeavour to please;” and of the men
of Tana, that “round their middle they tie a string, and below that
they employ the leaves of a plant like ginger, for the same purpose
and in the same manner as the natives of Mallicollo. Boys, as soon as
they attain the age of six years, are provided with these leaves; which
seems to confirm what I have observed in regard to the Mallicollese,
_viz._, that they do not employ this covering from motives of decency.
Indeed, it had so much the contrary appearance, that in the person
of every native of Tana or Mallicollo, we thought we beheld a living
representation of that terrible divinity who protected the orchard
and gardens of the ancients.”[1176] Speaking of the very simple dress
worn by the male Hottentot, Barrow says, “If the real intent of it
was the promotion of decency, it should seem that he has widely missed
his aim, as it is certainly one of the most immodest objects, in such
a situation as he places it, that could have been contrived.”[1177]
Among the Khyoungtha, there is a native tradition worth mentioning in
this connection. “A certain queen,” Captain Lewin tells us, “noticed
with regret that the men of the nation were losing their love for
the society of the women, and were resorting to vile and abominable
practices, from which the worst possible results might be expected.
She therefore prevailed upon her husband to promulgate a rigorous
order, prescribing the form of petticoat to be worn by all women in
future, and directing that the male should be tattooed, in order that,
by thus disfiguring the males, and adding _piquancy to the beauty of
the women_, the former might once more return to the feet of their
wives.”[1178]

Moreover, we know that some tribes who go perfectly naked are ashamed
to cover themselves, looking upon a garment as something indecent. The
pious father Gumilla was greatly astonished to find that the Indians on
the Orinoco did not blush at their nakedness. “Si les Missionnaires”
he says, “qui ignorent leurs coutumes s’avisent de distribuer des
mouchoirs, surtout aux femmes, pour qu’elles puissent se couvrir,
elles les jettent dans la rivière, où elles vont les cacher, pour
ne point être obligées de s’en servir; et lors qu’on leur dit de se
couvrir, elles répondent: ... ‘Nous ne couvrons point, _parce que cela
nous cause de la honte_.’”[1179] That this is no “traveller’s tale”
merely, appears from the following statement made by v. Humboldt with
reference to the New Andalusian Chaymas, who, like most savage peoples
dwelling in regions excessively hot, have an insuperable aversion to
clothing:—“Under the torrid zone,” he asserts, “ ... the natives are
ashamed, as they say, to be clothed; and flee to the woods when they
are too soon compelled to give up their nakedness.”[1180] Again, in an
Indian hut at Mucúra in Brazil, Mr. Wallace found the women entirely
without covering, and apparently quite unconscious of the fact. One of
them, however, possessed a “saía,” or petticoat, which she sometimes
put on, and seemed then, as Mr. Wallace says, “almost as much ashamed
of herself as civilized people would be if they took theirs off.”[1181]

There are several instances of peoples who, although they generally
go perfectly naked, sometimes use a covering. This they always do
under circumstances which plainly indicate that the covering is worn
simply as a means of attraction. Thus Lohmann tells us that, among
the Saliras, only harlots clothe themselves; and they do so in order
to excite through the unknown.[1182] In many heathen tribes in the
interior of Africa, according to Barth, the married women are entirely
nude, whilst the young marriageable girls cover their nakedness,—a
practice analogous to that of a married woman being deprived of her
ornaments and her hair.[1183] Mr. Mathews states that, in many parts
of Australia, “the females, and more especially young girls, wear a
fringe suspended from a belt round the waist.”[1184] Concerning the
natives of Botany Bay (New South Wales), Barrington remarks that “the
females at an early age wear a little apron, made from the skin of the
opossum or kangaroo, cut into slips, and hanging a few inches from
the waist; this they wear till they grow up and are taken by men, and
then they are left off.”[1185] Collins says the same of the girls at
Port Jackson;[1186] Mr. Palmer of some other Australians;[1187] and
Captain Snow of all those tribes among whom he had been for several
weeks.[1188] Again, on Moreton Island, according to Macgillivray, both
men and women went about altogether unclothed, but the female children
wore a small fringe in front. The same naturalist reports that, in
almost all the tribes of Torris Strait, the women wear a petticoat
of fine shreds of pandanus leaves, the ends worked into a waistband,
upon the construction of which much labour is expended; but it is only
“sometimes put on, especially by the young girls, and when about to
engage in dancing.” Under this, however, another covering is usually
worn.[1189] Among the Tupi tribes of Brazil, as soon as a girl became
marriageable “cotton cords were tied round her waist and round the
fleshy part of both arms; they denoted a state of maidenhood, and, if
any one but a maiden wore them, they were persuaded that the Anhanga
would fetch her away.... It cannot,” Mr. Southey adds, “have been
invented for the purpose of keeping the women chaste till marriage, for
these bands were broken without fear, and incontinence was not regarded
as an offence.”[1190] Among the Narrinyeri of Southern Australia, girls
wear a sort of apron of fringe until they bear their first child, and,
if they have no children, it is taken from them and burned by the
husband while they are asleep.[1191] In the Koombokkaburra tribe also,
the young women wear in front an apron of spun opossum fur, which is
generally given up after the birth of the first or second child.[1192]

There are several cases in which only the married women are clothed,
the unmarried going entirely naked.[1193] But such instances do not
conflict with the hypothesis suggested. Through long-continued use
covering loses its original character and becomes a sign of modesty,
whilst perfect nakedness becomes a stimulus. Usually, where nudity is
considered indecent, the garments of the girls of barbarous peoples
are restricted as much as possible, whilst those of the older women
are comparatively seemly. Thus, among the African Schulis, the married
women wear a narrow fringe of string in front, the unmarried wearing
nothing but bead ornaments.[1194] Among the natives of Tassai, New
Guinea, the former use a larger and thicker kind of petticoat of
pandanus leaf, divided into long grass-like shreds, reaching to the
knee; while that worn by the latter consists merely of single lengths
made fast to a string which ties round the waist.[1195] In Fiji,
the liku—a kind of band made from hibiscus-bark—is before marriage
worn very short, but after the birth of the first child is much
lengthened;[1196] and a similar practice occurs in other islands of the
South Sea.[1197]

The dances and festivals of many savage peoples are notoriously
accompanied by the most hideous licentiousness. Then the young men
and women endeavour to please each other in various ways, painting
themselves with brilliant colours, and decorating themselves with all
sorts of ornaments.[1198] On such occasions many tribes who go naked
in everyday life put on a scanty covering. Mr. Bonwick states that,
among the Tasmanians,
