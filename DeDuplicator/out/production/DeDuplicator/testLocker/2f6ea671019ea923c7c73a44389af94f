holly die out. This statement well agrees
with Professor Sprenger’s, that a regiment consisting of eight hundred
men loses within ten years more than seven hundred.[1593] It is
also, according to Colonel Hadden, a common report that, of a third
generation of pure Europeans in India, children only are, occasionally,
met with, and that they never reach the age of puberty.[1594] English
parents, as a rule, send their children to Europe when five or six
years old, as otherwise they would succumb.[1595] According to
Mr. Squier, it is the concurrent testimony of all intelligent and
observing men in Central America that the pure whites are there not
only relatively but absolutely decreasing in numbers, whilst the
pure Indians are rapidly increasing, and the Ladinos more and more
approximating to the aboriginal type.[1596]

The colour of the skin is justly considered one of the chief
characteristics of race. Now it is quite impossible to assign any
definite reason why one race is white, another black, brown, or
yellow. Nobody has yet been able to prove that the colour of the skin
is of any direct use to man, and it certainly is not the immediate
result of long exposure to a certain climate. But we know that there
exists an intimate connection between the colour of the skin and
bodily constitution. “Les colorations diverses,” says M. Godron,
“qui distinguent les différentes variétés de l’espèce humaine,
tiennent beaucoup moins aux agents physiques, qu’aux phénomènes les
plus intimes de l’organisation qui dans l’état actuel de la science,
nous échappent et resteront peut-être toujours couverts d’un voile
impénétrable.”[1597] Thus the alteration in the customary physiological
functions called acclimatization, seems often to be connected with
some change of colour not directly depending upon the influence of the
sun. Dr. Mayer observed that a European at the tropics loses his rosy
complexion, the difference in colour between arterial and venous blood
being strikingly diminished on account of the smaller absorption of
oxygen, which results from the feebler process of combustion.[1598]
According to Dr. Tylor, it is asserted that the pure negro in the
United States has undergone a change which has left him a shade lighter
in complexion;[1599] whilst a long medical experience at New Orleans
showed Dr. Visinié that the blood of the American negro has lost the
excess of plasticity which it possessed in Africa.[1600] A negro boy
brought to Germany by Gerhard Rohlfs, changed his colour after a
residence of two years, from deep black to light brown.[1601] Klinkosch
mentions the case of a negro who lost his blackness and became yellow;
and Caldani declares that a negro, who was a shoemaker at Venice,
was black when brought, during infancy, to that city, but became
gradually lighter, and had the hue of a person suffering from a slight
jaundice.[1602] In the ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ there is even a
record of a negro who became as white as a European.[1603] On the other
hand, we are told of an English gentleman Macnaughten by name, who
long lived the life of a native in the jungle of Southern India, and
acquired, even on the clothed portions of his body, a skin as brown as
that of a Brahman.[1604] These statements, if true, certainly refer to
exceedingly exceptional cases, but their accuracy cannot be _à priori_
denied. We know that certain organisms are much better able than others
to undergo the change which constitutes acclimatization, and we have
no positive reason to doubt that this power may, in abnormal cases, be
extraordinarily great. At any rate, it is beyond doubt that a close
connection exists between the colour of the skin and the physiological
functions of the body, on the one hand, and between these and the
conditions of life on the other. Disease is commonly accompanied by a
change of colour. Mr. Wallace observes that, in many islands of the
Malay Archipelago, species of widely different genera of butterflies
differ in precisely the same way as to colour or form from allied
species in other islands.[1605] The same thing occurs to a less degree
in other parts of the world also. And Agassiz has pointed out that,
in Asia and Africa, the large apes and the human races have the same
colour of the skin.[1606]

We may thus take for granted that racial peculiarities stand in some
connection with the external circumstances in which the various races
live. It may perhaps be objected that we meet with native tribes of
various types on the same degree of latitude, and under the same
climatic conditions.[1607] But we must remember that it is often
impossible to decide whether the conditions of life are exactly the
same; that intermixture of blood has caused a great confusion of racial
types; and that all peoples have arrived at their present localities
after more or less extensive migrations. We may be sure that some
characters have been preserved from earlier times when the race lived
in other circumstances, and that the higher its degree of civilization
the less likely it would be to lose the stamp impressed upon it.[1608]

It is, however, exceedingly doubtful whether racial differences are so
directly the result of external influences as anthropologists generally
believe,—that is, whether they are the inherited effects of conditions
of life to which previous generations have been subject. Professor
Weismann, as is well known, thinks that acquired characters are not
transmitted from parent to offspring. “It has never been proved,” he
says, “that acquired characters are transmitted, and it has never been
demonstrated that, without the aid of such transmission, the evolution
of the organic world becomes unintelligible.”[1609] Man has from time
immemorial mutilated his body in various ways, and there is not a
single well-founded case of these mutilations having been inherited
by the offspring.[1610] The children of accomplished pianists do not
inherit the art of playing the piano. Facts show that children of
highly civilized nations have no trace of a language, when they have
grown up in a wild condition and in complete isolation.[1611] Change in
colour influenced by sun and air is obviously temporary. The children
of the husbandman, or of the sailor, are just as fair as those of the
most delicate and pale inhabitant of a city; and, although the Moors,
who have lived in Africa since the seventh century, are generally in
mature life very sunburnt, their children are as white as those born in
Europe, and “restent blancs toute leur vie, quand leurs travaux ne les
exposent pas aux ardeurs du soleil.”[1612]

Such facts are certainly not in favour of the prevalent theory that the
differences of race are due to direct adaptation. Whether Professor
Weismann’s theory proves to be well founded or not, we manifestly
cannot assume that the heredity of acquired characters suffices to
explain the origin of the human races. It seems most probable that, at
the very earliest stages of human evolution, mankind was restricted to
a comparatively small area, and was then homogeneous, as every animal
and vegetable species is under similar conditions. In the struggle
for existence the intellectual faculties of man were developed, and
before the breaking away of isolated groups he may have invented the
art of making fire, and of fabricating the simplest implements and
weapons. This mental superiority made it possible for man to disperse,
enabling him to exist even under conditions somewhat different from
those to which he was originally adapted. His organism had to undergo
certain changes, but we are not aware that these modifications were
transmitted to descendants. All that we know is, that the children born
were not exactly like each other, and that those who happened to vary
most in accordance with the new conditions of life as a rule survived,
and became the ancestors of following generations. The congenital
characters which enabled them to survive were of course transmitted
to their offspring, and thus, through natural selection,[1613] races
would gradually arise, the members of each of which would have as
hereditary dispositions the same peculiarities as those which, to a
certain extent, may be acquired through acclimatization, but then
only for the individual himself, not for his descendants. We can thus
understand how the children of a negro are black[1614]—even if they are
born in Europe[1615]—as the black colour is the correlative of certain
physiological processes favourable to existence in the country of their
race. They survive, whilst the children of Europeans who have emigrated
to the tropics are carried off in great numbers, even though their
parents have succeeded in undergoing the functional modifications which
accompanied the change of abode.

This explanation of racial differences seems the more acceptable, when
we take into consideration the immense period which has elapsed since
man began to spread over the earth, and the slow and gradual change
of abodes. He was not at once moved from the tropics to the polar
zones, or from the polar zones to the tropics, but had to undergo an
indefinitely long chain of adaptive processes. Thus were gradually
established such radical differences as those which distinguish a
European from a negro, an Australian from a Red-skin.

       *       *       *       *       *

We have now found an answer to our question, why man, in the choice of
mate, gives the preference to the best representatives of his race. The
full development of racial characters indicates health, a deviation
from them indicates disease. Physical beauty is thus in every respect
the outward manifestation of physical perfection, or healthiness, and
the development of the instinct which prefers beauty to ugliness is
evidently within the power of natural selection.

This explanation of the connection between love and beauty, as also
of the origin of the races of men, is very different from that given
by Mr. Darwin. “The men of each race,” he says, “prefer what they
are accustomed to; they cannot endure any great change; but they
like variety, and admire each characteristic carried to a moderate
extreme.... As the great anatomist Bichat long ago said, if every one
were cast in the same mould, there would be no such thing as beauty.
If all our women were to become as beautiful as the Venus de’ Medici,
we should for a time be charmed; but we should soon wish for variety,
and as soon as we had obtained variety, we should wish to see certain
characters a little exaggerated beyond the then existing common
standard.”[1616]

In the fashions of our own dress, says Mr. Darwin, we see exactly
the same principle and the same desire to carry every point to an
extreme.[1617] Man prefers, to a certain extent, what he is accustomed
to see. Thus the Maoris, who are in the habit of dyeing their lips
blue, consider it “a reproach to a woman to have red lips;”[1618]
and we ourselves dislike, on the whole, any great deviation from the
leading fashions. But, on the other hand, man wants variety. Now in
one, now in another way, he changes his dress in order to attract
attention, or to charm. The fashions of savages are certainly more
permanent than ours;[1619] but the extreme diversity of ornaments with
which many uncivilized peoples bedeck themselves, shows their emulation
to make themselves attractive by means of new enticements. “Each
of the Outanatas (New Guinea),” says Mr. Earl, “seemed desirous of
ornamenting himself in some way different from his neighbour;”[1620]
and, with regard to the Pacific Islanders, Mr. John Williams remarks
that “the inhabitants of almost every group ... have their peculiar
ideas as to what constitutes an addition to beauty.”[1621] But it is
impossible to believe that the different races’ ideal of personal
beauty are in any way connected with this capriciousness of taste.
Were this the case, as Mr. Darwin suggests, the men of each race would
admire variations and piquant peculiarities in the appearance of their
women, and not only each _characteristic_ point “carried to a moderate
extreme.”

According to Mr. Darwin, racial differences are due to the different
standards of beauty, whereas, according to the theory here indicated,
the different standards of beauty are due to racial differences. “Let
us suppose,” says Mr. Darwin, “the members of a tribe, practising
some form of marriage, to spread over an unoccupied continent, they
would soon split up into distinct hordes, separated from each other
by various barriers, and still more effectually by the incessant wars
between all barbarous nations. The hordes would thus be exposed to
slightly different conditions and habits of life, and would sooner or
later come to differ in some small degree. As soon as this occurred,
each isolated tribe would form for itself a slightly different standard
of beauty; and then unconscious selection would come into action
through the more powerful and leading men preferring certain women to
others. Thus the differences between the tribes, at first very slight,
would gradually and inevitably be more or less increased.”[1622] This
theory—that racial differences are due to sexual selection—obviously
presupposes either that the human organism is alike well fitted to any
climate and natural conditions; or that no correlation exists between
the visible parts of the body and its functions. Otherwise, of course,
little effect could be produced through the preference given to certain
individuals; for in a savage state, where celibacy is an exception,
those men and women whose constitution was best suited to the
conditions of life would, in any case, in the end, determine the racial
type. It is also difficult to see how those slight variations from the
original human type, which, according to Mr. Darwin, characterized
the distinct hordes or tribes into which mankind was split up, could
have developed into such enormous differences as we find in the colour
of the skin of, for example, a negro and a European—only through the
selection of the best representatives of these tribal peculiarities,
these slight variations. Finally, it seems doubtful whether Mr. Darwin
would have ascribed racial differences in colour to the influence
of sexual selection, had he considered the important fact, already
mentioned, that the larger apes have the same colour of the skin as the
human races living in the same country.

Mr. Darwin also thinks that the differences in external appearance
between man and the lower animals are, to a certain extent, due to
sexual selection. The chief character of the human race which he
proposes to account for in this way is the general hairlessness of the
body. “No one supposes,” he says, “that the nakedness of the skin
is any direct advantage to man; his body therefore cannot have been
divested of hair through natural selection.”[1623] It is curious that
the hairlessness of man has puzzled so many anthropologists,[1624] as
it may very easily be explained by the law of variation. When man had
invented the art of making fire, and the idea of covering himself to
secure protection from cold had occurred to his mind, hairlessness
was no serious disadvantage in the struggle for existence. Hence
natural selection ceased to operate in the matter, and a hairless race
gradually arose. We find the same principle at work in various other
ways. Civilized man does not need such keen vision as savages;[1625]
consequently many of us are short-sighted and few Europeans could
match a Red Indian in his power of detecting the symptoms of a trail.
For the same reason we are generally inferior to savages in the
capacity for discriminating odours, and our teeth are apt to be very
much less sound and vigorous than theirs.

That sexual selection has had _some_ influence on the physical aspect
of mankind is probable. Accurate observers in different parts of the
world have remarked that personal deformities are very rare in savage
races unaffected by European influence.[1626] This chiefly depends upon
the fact that deformed individuals seldom survive the hardships of
early life, but, as Sir W. Lawrence says, if they do survive, they are
prevented by the kind of aversion they inspire from propagating their
deformities.[1627] It is not unlikely that the selection of the best
representatives of the race contributes to keep the racial type pure.
Sexual selection, too, may be the cause why, among savages, the men are
so often handsomer than the women—that is, better specimens of their
sex and their race;[1628] whilst, in civilized society, the reverse is
true. We have seen that savage women have great liberty of disposing
of their own hand, and that, at lower stages of civilization, celibacy
occurs almost exclusively among the men. Among us, on the contrary,
the unmarried women outnumber the unmarried men, and, whilst a man’s
ability to marry depends only to a small extent upon his personal
appearance, the like may certainly not be said of women.




CHAPTER XIII

THE LAW OF SIMILARITY


A powerful instinct keeps animals from pairing with individuals
belonging to another species than their own. “L’animal,” says
M. Duvernoy, “a l’instinct de se rapprocher de son espèce et de
s’éloigner des autres, comme il a celui de choisir ses aliments et
d’éviter les poisons.”[1629] Among Birds, there are found a small
number of wild hybrids, nearly all of which are in the order of
Gallinae, and most of which belong to the genus Tetrao.[1630] But among
Insects, Fishes, and Mammals, living in a state of nature, hybridism
is unknown or almost so.[1631] And, even among domesticated mammals,
some tricks are often required to deceive the male, and so to conquer
its aversion to a female of a different species. The stallion, for
instance, who is to cover a she-ass, is frequently first excited by the
presence of a mare, for which, at the proper moment, the she-ass is
substituted.[1632]

We may be sure that, were it not for this instinctive feeling, many
more animal hybrids would be naturally produced than is the case. In
the vegetable kingdom, where the play of instincts is altogether out
of the question, bastards occur much more frequently;[1633] and in
captivity a considerable number of animal hybrid forms are produced
that are never met with in a state of nature.[1634] Yet, according to
Mr. Darwin, there are good grounds for the doctrine of Pallas, that
the conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants
have been subjected, generally eliminate the tendency towards mutual
sterility, so that the domesticated descendants of species which
in their natural state would have been in some degree sterile when
crossed, become perfectly fertile.[1635]

The origin of this instinct, which helps to keep even closely allied
species in a state of nature distinct, seems to be sufficiently clear.
The number of species which have proved fertile together are very
limited, and the fertility of the hybrid offspring is almost constantly
diminished, often even to a very great extent. Of course, no one
now talks of the sterility of hybrids as a moral necessity—hybrids
being _animalia adulterina_,—or as the result of a special divine
decree, that new species should not be multiplied indefinitely.[1636]
M. Isidore Geoffroy has shown not only that hybrids may be fertile,
but that “infertile” hybrids are, properly speaking, merely the
hybrids which are most rarely fertile, their sterility never being
absolute.[1637] Moreover, as has been pointed out by Mr. Wallace, in
almost all the experiments that have hitherto been made in crossing
distinct species, no care has been taken to avoid close interbreeding;
hence these experiments cannot be held to prove that hybrids are
in all cases infertile _inter se_.[1638] But looking to all the
ascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals, we may
with Mr. Darwin conclude that some degree of sterility in hybrids is an
extremely general result.[1639] This being the case with the hybrids of
our domesticated animals, it must be so all the more with animals in a
state of nature, which generally live under conditions less favourable
to mutual fertility. It is easy to understand, then, that instincts
leading to intercrossing of different species, even if appearing
occasionally, never could be long-lived, as only those animals which
preferred pairing with individuals of their own species, gave birth
to an offspring endowed with a normal power of reproduction, and thus
became the founders of numerous generations that inherited their
instincts.

The relative or absolute sterility characterizing first crosses and
hybrids depends upon a biological law which might be called the “Law
of Similarity.” The degree of sterility, in either case,[1640] runs,
at least to a certain extent, parallel with the general affinity of
the forms that are united. Thus, most animal hybrids are produced by
individuals belonging to the same genus, whilst species belonging to
distinct genera can rarely, and those belonging to distinct families
perhaps never, be crossed.[1641] The parallelism, however, is not
complete, for a multitude of closely allied species will not unite,
or unite only with great difficulty, though other species, widely
different from each other, can be crossed with facility. Hence Mr.
Darwin infers that the difficulty or facility in crossing “apparently
depends exclusively on the sexual constitution of the species which
are crossed, or on their sexual elective affinity, _i.e._, the
‘Wahlverwandtschaft’ of Gärtner.” But as species rarely, or never,
become modified in one character, without being at the same time
modified in many, and as systematic affinity includes all visible
resemblances and dissimilarities, any difference in sexual constitution
between two species would naturally stand in more or less close
relation with their systematic position.[1642]

With regard to the instinct in question, man follows the general rule
in the animal kingdom. Our notions of morality are closely connected
with the instinctive feelings engraved in our nature; and bestiality
is commonly looked upon as one of the most heinous crimes of which man
can make himself guilty. Several passages both in ancient[1643] and
modern writers[1644] prove the occasional occurrence of this crime, but
always under circumstances analogous to those under which single birds
sometimes form connections against nature,[1645] _i.e._, either because
of isolation, or on account of vitiated instincts.[1646]

       *       *       *       *       *

Supporters of the hypothesis that the several races of man are distinct
species of the genus Homo, assert that an instinctive aversion similar
to that which keeps different animal species from intermingling, exists
also between the various human races.[1647] It may be noted by the
way that, even if this were true, the idea that mankind consists of
various species might be controverted; for certain races of domestic
or semi-domesticated animals seem to prefer breeding with their own
kind and refuse to mingle with others. Thus Mr. Bennett states that
the dark and pale coloured herds of fallow deer, which have long been
kept together in the Forest of Dean and two other places, have never
been known to mingle. On one of the Faroe Islands, the half-wild native
black sheep are said not to have readily mixed with the imported white
sheep. And in Circassia, where six sub-races of the horse are known and
have received distinct names, horses of three of these races, whilst
living a free life, almost always refuse to mingle and cross, and will
even attack each other.[1648] As for man, there are many races who
dislike marrying persons of another race, but the motives are various.
The different ideas of beauty no doubt play an important part. Mr.
Winwoode Reade does not think it probable that negroes would prefer
even the most beautiful European woman, on the mere grounds of physical
admiration, to a good-looking negress.[1649] A civilized race does not
readily intermingle with one less advanced in civilization, from the
same motives as those which prevent a lord from marrying a peasant
girl. And more than anything else, I think, the enmity, or at least,
want of sympathy, due to difference of interests, ideas, and habits,
which so often exist between distinct peoples or tribes, helps to keep
races separate. But such reasons as these have nothing in common with
the instinctive feeling which deters animals of distinct species from
pairing with each other. Hence, when two races come into very close
mutual contact, especially if they are at about the same stage of
civilization, their dislike to intermarriage commonly disappears.

Mongrels form, indeed, a large proportion of the inhabitants of the
world. It is doubtful whether there are any pure races in Europe; not
even the Basques can pretend to purity of blood.[1650] M. Broca found,
when investigating the subject of stature, that nineteen-twentieths
of the whole population of France presented, in various degrees, the
characters of mixed races.[1651] In North America, different races
intermingle more and more every day. In Greenland, according to Dr.
Nansen, in the course of a century and a half there has been such
an intermixture of races that it would now be extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to find a true Eskimo throughout the whole of
the west coast; and the Europeans, far from being disliked by the
native women have succeeded in inspiring them with so much respect
that the “simplest European sailor is preferred to the best Eskimo
seal catcher.”[1652] In Mexico, the Spanish mixed breeds constitute
two-thirds or three-fourths of the whole population;[1653] and South
America, to quote a French writer, is “le grand laboratoire des
nations hybrides ou métisses modernes.”[1654] Of twelve millions of
mongrels, which is the estimated number of mongrels on the face of
the globe, no fewer than eleven millions are found there.[1655] Even
in remote Tierra del Fuego, according to Mr. Bridges, some mongrels of
European fathers and indigenous mothers have appeared during the last
few years.

In Asia there are numberless instances of intermixture of breed between
the Tartars, Mongols, and Tunguses, and the Russians and Chinese,
&c.[1656] In India there are many Eurasians; in the Indian Archipelago
Chinese and Malays intermarry;[1657] and, in the Islands of the South
Sea, the mongrels of European fathers amount to a considerable number.
In Africa, the eastern Soudan is a great centre of mixed breeds between
races much removed from one another. And, in Southern Africa, the
Griquas—the offspring of Dutch colonists and Hottentot women—form a
very distinct race.

As far as we know, there are no human races who, when intermingled,
are entirely sterile. But as regards the degree of fertility of first
crosses and of mongrels, the opinions of different anthropologists
vary considerably. Those who do not believe in the unity of the human
race have been especially solicitous to prove that crosses are almost
inevitably followed by bad results in that respect. Thus Dr. Knox
thinks that the half-breeds, if they were abandoned to themselves
and no longer had access to pure races, would rapidly disappear, the
“hybrid” being rejected by nature as a degradation of humanity.[1658]
Dr. Nott asserts that, when two proximate species of mankind, two
races bearing a general resemblance to each other in type, are bred
together, they produce offspring perfectly prolific; but that, when
species the most widely separated, such as the Anglo-Saxon and the
negro, are crossed, the mulatto offspring are but partially prolific,
and acquire an inherent tendency to run out, and become eventually
extinct, when kept apart from the parent stocks.[1659] The same opinion
is entertained by M. Broca, and by M. Pouchet, who thinks that the
crossed race will exist only if it continues to be supported by the
two creating types remaining in the midst of it.[1660]

On the other hand, Dr. Prichard believes it may be asserted, without
the least chance of valid contradiction, that mankind, of all races and
varieties, are equally capable of having offspring by intermarriage,
and that such connections are equally prolific whether contracted
between individuals of the same variety or of the most dissimilar
varieties. “If there is any difference,” he says, “it is probably
in favour of the latter.”[1661] According to M. Godron, the mongrels
have generally shown a higher degree of fertility than their parent
races;[1662] and M. Quatrefages asserts that mulattoes are as fruitful
as pure breeds.[1663]

It is to be regretted that so little attention has for some time been
paid to this most important question. The result is that the effects
of the intermixture of races are not much better known now, than they
were twenty or thirty years ago. The only thing which may be considered
certain is, that the hypothesis of the depressing influence of crossing
upon fertility, as the theory has generally been propounded, involves
a great deal of exaggeration. It is chiefly owing to M. Broca’s
celebrated essay, ‘Sur l’hybridité,’ that this doctrine has been so
widely accepted. He asserts that the connections of Europeans with
Australian women have proved very slightly prolific, and that the
mongrels resulting from them are almost sterile. “No statistical
writer,” he says, “nor any historian, enumerates cross-breeds among
the Australian population.”[1664] Yet, this land has for a considerable
time been inhabited by European colonists, many of whom have not had
opportunities of marrying wives of their own race. It has also been
shown that the cohabitation of whites and native women is very common
in Australia. But the number of mongrels there is, nevertheless,
exceedingly small, so small that in the native dialects there does not
exist a single word to designate them.[1665]

Supposing that these remarkable statements referred chiefly to the
eastern and southern parts of the Australian continent, I asked Bishop
R. Salvado and the Rev. Joseph Johnston, living in West Australia, to
inform me whether, in that country, any mixed race exists, and, if so,
whether it is fruitful or not. From the former, who has lived among the
West Australian aborigines for more than forty years, and through an
excellent work on their life and customs has gained the reputation of
a first-rate authority, I had the pleasure of receiving the following
answer, dated New Norcia, October 17, 1888:—“With regard to the
sterility of the half-caste natives, of which I had no experience when
I wrote my book, I am able now to deny it altogether, except in cases
similar to those among the Europeans. I know several cases of husband
and wife, half-caste natives, having at present six and seven and even
eight children, and they may in time have more; and I know a good many
Europeans who, having married native women, have several children. In
fact, in the case of one of those marriages there were six children,
and in another seven, and I could give the name of each of them.”
The Rev. J. Johnston writes, “There is a school for half-caste boys
and girls at Perth, and they seem bright and intelligent children,
not unlike Polynesian children. As they grow up, they go out to
service, and some of the youths are employed as post and telegraph
messengers.... At the New Norcia mission, there are several half-caste
families, as well as blacks, and they all have children.” The following
statement of Mr. Taplin referring to the aborigines of the Lower
Murray, goes in the same direction:—“The pure blacks,” he says,
“are not so healthy as the half-castes. Always the children of two
half-castes will be healthier and stronger than either the children of
blacks or the children of a black and a half-caste. When a half-caste
man and woman marry, they generally have a large and vigorous family. I
could point to half a dozen such.”[1666]

These statements of highly competent persons are, I think, quite
sufficient to disprove M. Broca’s hypothesis. They show that, if
a mixed race is almost wanting in certain parts of Australia, this
does not depend upon physiological conditions of the kind suggested.
It should be remembered that the sexual intercourse of Europeans
with savage women is most commonly transitory and accidental, and
frequently takes place with prostitutes or licentious women, who are
generally known to be sterile. And, even when the white settler takes
a native’s daughter to live with him under his own roof as a wife or
a concubine, and accustoms her to a half-civilized manner of living,
her unfruitfulness[1667] may be owing to quite another cause than the
mixture of blood. Mr. Darwin has shown that changed conditions of
life have an especial power of acting injuriously on the reproductive
system. Thus animals, as also plants, when removed from their natural
conditions, are often rendered in some degree infertile or completely
barren, even when the conditions have not been greatly changed. And
this failure of animals to breed under confinement cannot, at least
to any considerable extent, depend upon a failure in their sexual
instincts. “Numerous cases,” says Mr. Darwin, “have been given of
various animals which couple freely under confinement, but never
conceive; or, if they conceive and produce young, these are fewer in
number than is natural to the species.”[1668] It is reasonable to
suppose that savage man, when he moves into more civilized conditions,
is subject to the same law. Indeed, statements have been reported to
me, which tend to show that the indigenous women at the Polynesian
missionary stations have become less fruitful than they were in their
native state. As to the alleged sterility of crosses between the
European and Australian races, it should be observed that the rarity
of mongrels in certain parts of Australia is more or less owing to
the natives themselves habitually destroying the half-castes.[1669]
The Rev. A. Meyer states that, in the Encounter Bay tribe, “nearly
all the children of European fathers used to be put to death;”[1670]
whilst, among the Narrinyeri, about one-half of the half-caste infants
fell victims to the jealousy of their mothers’ husbands.[1671] But
with regard to the West Australian aborigines in the neighbourhood of
Fremantle, the Rev. J. Johnston writes that he does not think it has
been the custom there to destroy the half-caste illegitimate offspring
of black women, as he never heard of such a thing,—a fact which may
account for the comparatively large number of mongrels in that part of
the continent.

Other statements also, adduced as evidence for the hypothesis of
M. Broca, have proved more or less untrustworthy. Thus the alleged
sterility of the mulattoes of Jamaica[1672] has been disputed by other
writers.[1673] So also v. Görtz’s statement that the children of the
Dutch and Malay women in Java (Lipplapps) are only productive to the
third generation,[1674] has been called in question.[1675]

Yet, although we may consider it certain that the diversities even
between the races which least resemble each other are not so great
but that, under favourable conditions, a mixed race may easily be
produced, I do not deny the possibility of crossing being, to a certain
extent, unfavourable to fertility. The statements as to the rapid
increase of some mixed races do not prove the reverse. For the bad
result of crossing would not necessarily appear at once; and a drop
of pure blood would be sufficient to increase fertility, just as,
when a hybrid is crossed with either pure parent species, sterility
is usually much lessened.[1676] It is a remarkable fact that mixed
marriages between Jews and persons of other races are comparatively
infertile. In Prussia, these marriages have been separately registered
since 1875, and between that year and 1881 there was an average of
1·63 to a marriage, whereas, during the same period, pure Jewish
marriages resulted in an average of 4·41 children or very nearly three
times as many. In Bavaria, between 1876 and 1880, the numbers were
only 1·1 per marriage against 4·7 children to purely Jewish marriages.
And this conspicuous infertility implies greater sterility. Among
fifty-six such marriages, with regard to which Mr. Jacobs ascertained
the results, no fewer than nine were sterile, _i.e._, 18 per cent.,—a
striking contrast to the number of sterile marriages which he found in
seventy-one marriages between Jewish cousins, where the percentage of
sterility was only 5·4 per cent.[1677] Mr. Jacobs, however, informs
me that it has been suggested that this infertility may be due rather
to the higher age at which such marriages are likely to take place.
There is still a strong feeling against them among Jews, which is
only likely to be overcome after independence of thought and position
has been reached. At the same time Mr. Jacobs does not consider this
sufficient to account for the very great discrepancy. But we must not,
of course, take for granted that the crossing of any two races has the
same effects as the crossing of Jewish and non-Jewish Europeans seems
to have.

Even if it could be proved, however, that mixture of races produces
lessened fertility of first crosses and of mongrels, this would not
make it necessary for us to reject the doctrine of the unity of
mankind. It is true that the domesticated varieties both of animals and
of plants, when crossed, are as a general rule prolific, in some cases
even more so than the purely bred parent varieties; whereas species,
when crossed, and their hybrid offspring, are almost invariably in some
degree sterile. But this rule is not altogether without exceptions.
Even Agassiz condemned the employment of fertility of union as a
limiting principle. He considered this a fallacy, “or at least a
_petitio principii_, not admissible in a philosophical discussion of
what truly constitutes the characteristics of species.”[1678] Thus the
red and yellow varieties of maize are in some degree infertile when
crossed, and the blue-and the red-flowered forms of the pimpernel,
considered by most botanists to be the same species, as they present no
differences of form or structure, are, according to Gärtner, mutually
sterile. Moreover, Mr. Darwin’s investigations on dimorphic and
trimorphic plants have shown that the physiological test of lessened
fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion
of specific distinction.[1679] As for animals, Professor Vogt asserts
that, in the opinion of experienced breeders, certain races can with
difficulty be made to pair, and the fertility of the mongrels soon
diminishes, whilst other races pair readily and are prolific.[1680]
Sir J. Sebright says, “Although I believe the occasional intermixture
of different families to be necessary, I do not, by any means, approve
of mixing two distinct breeds, with the view of uniting the valuable
properties of both: this experiment has been frequently tried by others
as well as by myself, but has, I believe, never succeeded. The first
cross frequently produces a tolerable animal, but it is a breed that
cannot be continued.”[1681]




CHAPTER XIV

PROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN KINDRED


The horror of incest is an almost universal characteristic of mankind,
the cases which seem to indicate a perfect absence of this feeling
being so exceedingly rare that they must be regarded merely as
anomalous aberrations from a general rule.

Yet the degrees of kinship within which intercourse is forbidden, are
by no means everywhere the same. It is most, and almost universally,
abominated between parents and children, especially mother and
son. As an exception to this rule, v. Langsdorf states that, among
the Kaniagmuts, not only do brothers and sisters cohabit with each
other, but even parents and children.[1682] The Eastern Tinneh, or
Chippewyans, occasionally marry their mothers, sisters, or daughters,
but such alliances are not considered correct by general opinion.[1683]
In the Indian Archipelago, according to Schwaner, Wilken, and Riedel,
marriages between brothers and sisters, and parents and children,
are permitted among certain tribes;[1684] and similar unions, it is
said, took place among the ancient Persians.[1685] Again, in Nukahiva,
as we are told by Lisiansky, although near kinsfolk are forbidden to
intermarry, it sometimes happens that a father lives with his daughter,
and a brother with his sister; but on one occasion it was looked
upon as a horrible crime when a mother cohabited with her son.[1686]
Among the Kukis, as described by Rennel, marriages were generally
contracted without regard to blood-relationship; only a mother might
not wed her child.[1687] Among the Karens of Tenasserim, “matrimonial
alliances between brother and sister, or father and daughter, are not
uncommon.”[1688] Speaking of the King of the Warua, Mr. Cameron states
that in his harem are to be found his stepmothers, aunts, sisters,
nieces, cousins, as also his own daughters.[1689] Among the Wanyoro,
brothers may marry their sisters, and even fathers their daughters; but
a son does not marry his own mother, although the other widows of his
father become his property.[1690]

Unions between brothers and sisters, who are children of the same
mother as well as the same father, are likewise held in general
abhorrence. The primitive feeling against such connections is strongly
expressed in the Finnish Kullervo Myth. The unfortunate Kullervo, after
discovering that he had committed incest with his sister, wails—

    “Woe is me, my life hard-fated!
    I have slain my virgin-sister,
    Shamed the daughter of my mother;
    Woe to thee my ancient father!
    Woe to thee, my gray-haired mother!
    Wherefore was I born and nurtured,
    Why this hapless child’s existence?”[1691]

The dishonoured sister threw herself into the river, and Kullervo fell
by his own sword.

The Californian Nishinam believe that, for the prevention of incest,
at the beginning of the world, not one but two pairs were created from
whom sprang all the Nishinam.[1692] When the missionary Jellinghaus
once asked some Munda Kols whether animals knew what is right and
wrong, the answer was, “No, because they do not know mother, sister,
and daughter.”[1693] Yet, as we have seen, there are exceptions to the
rule; and certain peoples who consider intercourse between parents and
children incestuous, allow unions between brothers and sisters. Among
the Kamchadales, says Krasheninnikoff, “marriage is forbidden only
between father and daughter, mother and son.”[1694] Not long ago, the
wild Veddahs of Ceylon regarded the marriage of a man with his younger
sister as not only proper and natural, but, in fact, as _the_ proper
marriage, though marriage with an elder sister or aunt would have been
as incestuous and revolting to them as to us.[1695] Among the Annamese,
according to a missionary who has lived among them for forty years,
no girl who is twelve years old and has a brother is a virgin.[1696]
Liebich tells us that the Gypsies allow a brother to marry his sister,
though such marriages are generally avoided by them.[1697] Among the
Wa-taïta, says Mr. Thomson, “very few of the young men are able to
marry for want of the proper number of cows—a state of affairs which
not unfrequently leads to marriage with sisters, though this practice
is highly reprobated.”[1698] Among the aborigines of Brazil, union with
a sister, or a brother’s daughter, is almost universally held to be
infamous. Such practices are not uncommon in small isolated hordes;
“but the ancient Tupinambases (ancestors of the Tupis) allowed
nothing of the kind openly.”[1699] In a song of the ‘Rig-Veda,’ Yamí
appears in support of the marriage of brother and sister, while the
opposition is personified in Yama.[1700] Buddhist legends mention
various cases of such unions;[1701] and it is stated in the ‘Ynglinga
Saga’ that “while Niord was with the Vans he had taken his own sister
in marriage, for that he was allowed by their law.”[1702] But we have
no evidence whatever that such unions were commonly allowed by the
ancient Scandinavians. “Among the Asas,” the ‘Ynglinga Saga’ adds,
“it was forbidden for such near relatives to come together.”[1703] In
Scandinavia, according to Nordström, as also among the ancient Germans,
according to Grimm, marriages between parents and children, brothers
and sisters, were prohibited.[1704]

Unions with sisters, or probably, in most cases, half-sisters, occur
in the royal families of Baghirmi,[1705] Siam,[1706] Burma,[1707]
Ceylon,[1708] and Polynesia.[1709] In the Sandwich Islands, brothers
and sisters of the reigning family intermarried, but this incestuous
intercourse was in other cases contrary to the customs, habits, and
feelings of the people.[1710] And, in Iboína of Madagascar, where the
kings were occasionally united with their sisters, such marriages
were preceded by a ceremony in which the woman was sprinkled with
consecrated water, and prayers were recited asking for her happiness
and fecundity, as if there was a fear that the union might call down
divine anger upon the parties.[1711] Cambyses and other Persian kings
married their sisters,[1712] and so did the Ptolemies of Egypt.[1713]
According to Sir Gardner Wilkinson, it is not only noticed by Diodorus,
but is fully authenticated by the inscriptions both of Upper and Lower
Egypt, that the same custom was in force among the Egyptians, from the
earliest times;[1714] but, except in the case of the Ptolemies, I have
seen no clear evidence that marriage took place between brothers and
sisters who had both the same father and the same mother. Garcilasso de
la Vega states that the Incas of Peru, from the first, established it
as a very stringent law that the heir to the kingdom should marry his
eldest sister, legitimate both on the side of the father and on that of
the mother;[1715] whereas, according to Acosta and Ondegardo, it had
always been held unlawful by the Peruvians to contract marriage in the
first degree, until Tupac Inca Yupanqui, at the close of the fifteenth
century, married his sister on the fathers side, and decreed “that
the Incas might marry with their sisters by the father’s side, and no
other.”[1716]

It has been asserted that, where the system of exogamy prevails, a
man is allowed to marry his sister either on the father’s or on the
mother’s side, according as descent is reckoned in the female or in
the male line.[1717] But it will be shown directly that, besides the
rules relating to exogamy, there are commonly others prohibiting
intermarriage of near relations belonging to different tribes or clans.
Yet the marriage of half-brother and half-sister is not rare. Among the
Ostyaks, for instance, union with a half-sister bearing another family
name is in great repute;[1718] and the South Slavonian Mohammedans
allow marriages between half-brothers and half-sisters who have
different mothers, though seducing a sister is regarded in their songs
as a crime punishable with death, or rather as something which cannot
occur.[1719] From the Book of Genesis we know that Abraham married
his half-sister, and looked upon the union as lawful, because she had
not the same mother.[1720] Among the Phœnicians at Tyre, down to the
time of Achilles Tatius, a man might marry his father’s daughter: and
the same thing appears at Mecca.[1721] Marriage with half-sisters on
the father’s side, not on the mother’s, was also allowed among the
Assyrians[1722] and the Athenians.[1723] In Guatemala and Yucatan,
on the other hand, no relationship on the mother’s side was a bar to
marriage: hence a man could marry his sister, provided she was by
another father.[1724]

Among certain peoples the relationships of uncle and niece, and of
aunt and nephew, are the remotest degrees of consanguinity which are a
hindrance to intermarriage. This is the case, for instance, with some
of the Dyak tribes;[1725] and among the Copper Indians, according to
Franklin, there is no prohibition of the intermarriage of cousins,
but a man is forbidden to marry his niece.[1726] On the whole, we may
say that marriage within these degrees of relationship is even more
commonly prohibited than intermarriage of cousins, and that, probably
in most cases, the prohibitions refer to persons so related either on
the father’s or mother’s side.[1727] Yet there are many instances to
the contrary.[1728] The Ossetes consider a marriage with a mother’s
sister quite a proper thing, though a marriage with a father’s sister
would be punished as highly incestuous.[1729] Among the Reddies of the
South of India, a man marries his sister’s daughter, but a nephew must
not marry his aunt;[1730] and, among the Brazilian Tupis, an uncle had
even a right to his niece’s hand.[1731] By the Prussian law, marriage
between uncle and niece is permitted; whilst, in France, such marriages
may be sanctioned by the Government, in Italy by the King.[1732]

In Europe, first cousins are not restricted from intermarriage,
except in Spain, where the old canonical prohibitions are still in
force; and in Russia, where third cousins are allowed to marry, but
no parties more nearly related.[1733] Among the Mohammedans[1734] and
several uncivilized peoples, marriages between cousins, both on the
paternal and maternal side, are permitted. So, apparently, among the
Aleuts,[1735] Eskimo at Igloolik,[1736] Apalachites,[1737] Maoris,
Bushmans[1738] and Ainos,[1739]—besides the people just referred to.
More commonly, however, the permission is one-sided, referring either
to the kinsfolk on the father’s, or to those on the mother’s side.
Among the Arabs, a man has even a right to the hand of his paternal
cousin, who cannot without his consent, become the wife of any other
person.[1740] Concerning the Moors of Ceylon, Mr. Ahamadu Bawa states
that in all cases where eligible sons of mothers’ brothers or fathers’
sisters were available for the girls, preference was accorded to them,
“almost as a matter of right.”[1741] Among the savage Miao of China,
the girls are obliged to marry the mother’s brothers’ sons.[1742] The
Gonds consider it correct for the brother’s daughter to marry the
sister’s son, whilst not so much stress is laid on the marriage of the
cousins, if the sister’s child happens to be a girl and the brother’s
a boy.[1743] Among the Yerkalas of Southern India, “the first two
daughters of a family may be claimed by the maternal uncle as wives for
his sons.”[1744]

As a rule, among peoples unaffected by modern civilization the
prohibited degrees are more numerous than in advanced communities, the
prohibitions in a great many cases referring even to all the members of
the tribe or clan.

The Greenlanders, according to Egede, refrained from marrying their
nearest kin, even in the third degree, considering such matches to be
“unwarrantable and quite unnatural;”[1745] whilst Dr. Rink asserts
that “the Eskimo disapproves of marriages between cousins.”[1746]
The same is the case with the Ingaliks,[1747] the Chippewas,[1748]
and, as a rule, the Indians of Oregon.[1749] The Californian Gualala
account it “poison,” as they say, for a person to marry a cousin or
an avuncular relation, and strictly observe in marriage the Mosaic
table of prohibited affinities.[1750] “By the old custom of the Aht
tribes,” Mr. Sproat remarks, “no marriage was permitted within the
degree of second cousin;”[1751] and among the Mahlemuts, “cousins,
however remote, do not marry.”[1752] Commonly a man and woman belonging
to the same clan are prohibited from intermarrying. The Algonquins tell
of cases where men, for breaking this rule, have been put to death by
their nearest kinsfolk;[1753] and, among the Loucheux Indians, if a man
marries within the clan, he is said to have married his sister, though
there be not the slightest connection by blood between the two.[1754]
In some tribes, as Mr. Frazer points out, the marriage prohibition only
extends to a man’s own clan: he may marry a woman of any clan but his
own. But oftener the prohibition includes several clans, in none of
which is a man allowed to marry.[1755] Thus, for instance, the Seneca
tribe of the Iroquois was divided into two “phratries,” or divisions
intermediate between the tribe and the clan, each including four clans;
the Bear, Wolf, Beaver, and Turtle clans forming one phratry, and
the Deer, Snipe, Heron, and Hawk clans forming the other. Originally
marriage was prohibited within the phratry, but was permitted with any
of the clans of the other phratry; but the prohibition was long since
removed, and a Seneca may marry a woman of any clan but his own.[1756]
A like exogamous division existed among the other four tribes of the
Iroquois,[1757] as also among the Creeks, Moquis, Choctaws, Chickasaws,
Thlinkets, &c.[1758]

Among the Pipiles of Salvador, an ancestral tree, with seven main
branches, denoting degrees of kindred, was painted upon cloth, and
within these seven branches or degrees, no one was allowed to marry,
except as a recompense for some great public or warlike service
rendered. But within four degrees of consanguinity none, under any
pretext, might marry.[1759] In Yucatan, there was a strong prejudice
against a man wedding a woman who bore the same name as his own, and
so far was this fancy carried, that he who broke the rule was looked
upon as a renegade and an outcast. Nor could a man marry his mother’s
sister.[1760] Among the Azteks, too, marriages between blood-relations
or those descended from a common ancestor were not allowed.[1761]

Among the tribes of Guiana, according to Mr. Im Thurn, marriage is now
almost always, as formerly it was always, contracted between members
of different families, and, descent being traced through females, no
intermarriage with relations on the mother’s side is permitted.[1762]
The Mundrucûs are divided into clans, the members of which are strictly
prohibited from forming alliances with others of the same clan. “A
Mundrucû Indian,” says Professor Agassiz, “treats a woman of the same
order (clan) with himself as a sister, any nearer relation between them
is impossible.”[1763] The Indians of Peru are restricted from marriage
within the first four degrees.[1764] The Guaranies and Abipones abhor
alliances with even the remotest relations.[1765] And as to the Yahgans
of Tierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges writes to me that “no marriage, no
intercourse ever takes place among blood-relations even to second
cousins.” Such intercourse is held in utter abomination and is never
heard of. Also between half-brothers and half-sisters marriages do not
occur.

Nowhere is marriage bound by more severe laws than among the Australian
aborigines. Their tribes are, as a rule—and probably as a rule without
exceptions[1766]—grouped in exogamous subdivisions, the number of which
varies considerably. There are tribes in which members of any clan
are free to marry members of any clan but their own; but such tribes
are exceptional.[1767] “Often,” says Mr. Frazer, “an Australian
tribe is divided into two (exogamous) phratries, each of which
includes under it a number of totem clans; and oftener still there
are sub-phratries interposed between the phratry and the clans, each
phratry including two sub-phratries, and the sub-phratries including
totem clans.”[1768] Most of Mr. Curr’s very numerous correspondents
who have touched on this question have, however, given the number of
subdivisions in their neighbourhood as four only.[1769] Before the
occupation of the country by the whites, which quickly breaks down
aboriginal customs, any departure from the marriage system founded on
this division was looked on with absolute horror, and even spoken of
with reluctance. Indeed, when marriage or sexual intercourse with a
person of a forbidden clan did occur, the regular penalty inflicted
on the parties implicated was death.[1770] And it is a noteworthy
fact, generally overlooked by anthropologists, that besides these
prohibitions arising from the clan-system and, naturally, applying only
to the father’s or, more generally, only to the mother’s relations,
there is, as it seems everywhere, a law which forbids the marriage of
persons near of kin.[1771] “A man,” says Mr. Curr, “may not marry
his mother, sister, half-sister, daughter, granddaughter, aunt, niece,
first or second cousin.”[1772] Among the Kurnai of Gippsland, according
to Mr. Bulmer, even third cousins are within the prohibited degrees
of relationship.[1773] Moreover, certain tribes, besides having the
clan-system, are entirely exogamous;[1774] and, among the tribes of
Western Victoria described by Mr. Dawson, the laws also forbid a man to
marry into his mother’s tribe, or his grandmother’s tribe or into an
adjoining tribe, or one that speaks his own dialect.[1775]

In Tasmania, a man was not permitted to marry a woman of his own tribe
(clan?);[1776] and in Polynesia, marriages with blood-relations were
everywhere avoided except in royal families.[1777] Thus in Samoa,
according to Mr. Turner, so much care was taken to prevent incest
that a list of what they deemed improper marriages would almost
compare with the ‘Table of Kindred and Affinity.’ They say that,
of old, custom and the gods frowned upon the union of those in whom
consanguinity could be closely traced.[1778]

Speaking of the aborigines of the Melanesian islands, Dr. Codrington
observes, “In the native view of mankind, almost everywhere in
the islands which are here under consideration, nothing seems more
fundamental than the division of the people into two or more classes,
which are exogamous, and in which descent is counted through the
mother.” Yet “the blood connection with the father and the father’s
near relations is never out of sight. Consequently the marriage of
those who are near in blood, though they are not ‘sogoi’ (_i.e._,
kindred), and may lawfully marry, is discountenanced.”[1779] In
New Britain, if a man were accused of adultery or fornication with
a woman, he would at once be acquitted by the public voice if he
could say, “She is one of us,” _i.e._, she belongs to my totem,
which in itself precludes the possibility of any sexual intercourse
between us.[1780] In Efate, of the New Hebrides, it would be a crime
punishable with death for a man or woman to marry a person belonging
to his or her mother’s clan, “though they may have no recent relation
of consanguinity to each other, and though neither they nor their
parents may have even seen each other before.”[1781] In Lifu, as I am
informed by Mr. Radfield, who is a resident of this island, marriages
are forbidden between first, but not second cousins, both on the
mother’s and father’s side, as well as between uncles and nieces,
aunts and nephews. Matrimonial alliances between first cousins are
also prohibited in the Caroline Islands;[1782] whilst, in the Pelew
Group, intermarriage between any relations on the mother’s side is
unlawful.[1783]

Among the Sea Dyaks, it is contrary to custom for a man to wed a first
cousin, who is looked upon as a sister, and no marriage is allowed with
aunt or niece. The Land Dyaks permit marriage between second cousins
only after the payment of a fine of two jars, one being given by the
woman to the relations of her lover, the other by the lover to her
relation.[1784] In other tribes of the Malay Archipelago, according
to Mr. Crawfurd, the union of near relatives is prohibited by the
native laws, and, when such a marriage does take place, the parties are
fined if within the third degree of consanguinity collaterally. In the
ascending and descending line marriage is strictly forbidden.[1785]
Among the Minahassers of Celebes, marriage was not permitted between
ascendants and descendants, brothers and sisters, uncles and nieces,
aunts and nephews, and cousins, or between kinsfolk connected by
combinations of these relationships.[1786] The Malays of the uplands
of Padang are forbidden to marry within the mother’s tribe; the Bataks
of Sumatra, Alfura of Ceram and Buru, Niasians, and Timorese, within
the father’s.[1787] Among the Italones of the Philippines, marriage
between blood-relations is not allowed.[1788] The Bugis[1789] and
Watubela Islanders[1790] prohibit the intermarriage of cousins,
paternal and maternal; whilst, among the Orang-Banûwa of Malacca,[1791]
the Macassars,[1792] and the natives of Aru, near New Guinea,[1793]
children of brothers cannot intermarry, though children of sisters,
or of brothers and sisters, can. Again, among the Lettis of the
Serwatty Islands, marriage may take place between brothers’ children,
and between brothers’ and sisters’ children, but not between children
of two sisters;[1794] and, among the Bataks, Rejangs, and natives of
Amboina, a sister’s son is allowed to marry a brother’s daughter,
whereas a brother’s son must not marry a sister’s daughter.[1795]
The penalty inflicted on incest is generally very severe in the
Archipelago. Submersion is a common punishment;[1796] and, among the
Bataka, the parties were killed and eaten.[1797]

With reference to the Karens of Burma, Dr. Bunker informs me that,
though they never marry outside their own tribe, they avoid marrying
with near relations, their prohibited degrees being nearly the same
as those of the ancient Hebrews. Among the Kukis, according to
Lieutenant Stewart, “the most strict rules exist forbidding too close
intermarriage in families; cousins cannot be so allied.”[1798] The
Nagas never permit marriage within the same family;[1799] and, among
the Chukmas, if near relatives, within certain prohibited degrees, fall
in love with each other, it is usual for both of them to pay a fine of
fifty rupees, corporal punishment being also administered.[1800] Among
the Kandhs, “intermarriage between persons of the same tribe, however
large or scattered, is considered incestuous and punishable with
death.”[1801] The Santals make it a rule not to intermarry into the
same tribe;[1802] and, among the Sakais, a man goes to a considerable
distance for a wife, generally to a tribe speaking quite a different
dialect.[1803] The Juángs, Hos, Mundas, and other peoples in India are
divided into clans, and a man is not allowed to marry a girl of his own
clan.[1804] Among the Garos, no one may take to wife a woman of the
same “mahári,” or motherhood.[1805]

According to Lieutenant-Colonel Tod, no Rajput can marry in his own
clan.[1806] “In all pure Hindu society,” Sir Alfred Lyall states,
“the law which regulates the degrees within which marriage is
interdicted, proceeds upon the theory that between agnatic relatives
_connubium_ is impossible.”[1807] Hence it is unlawful for a Brahman
to wed a woman whose clan-name is the same as his own, a prohibition
which bars marriage among relatives in the male line indefinitely.
But besides this, connections on the female side are also forbidden
to take place within certain wide limits.[1808] In the ‘Laws of
Manu’ we read that a damsel “who is neither a Sapindâ[1809] on the
mother’s side, nor belongs to the same family on the father’s side, is
recommended to twice-born men for wedlock and conjugal union.”[1810]
Yet in the older literature marriage with the daughters of the mother’s
brother, and sons of the father’s sister, is permitted.[1811] This
still holds good among the Reddies of Southern India, and, as it seems,
among other tribes belonging to the Hindu stock; whereas children
of fathers’ brothers and mothers’ sisters are considered equal to
brothers and sisters, and marriage with them is looked upon as highly
incestuous.[1812]

Speaking of the Andamanese, Mr. Man says that “their customs do not
permit of the union of any who are known to be even distantly related;
the fact of our allowing first cousins to marry seems to them highly
objectionable and immoral.”[1813] The Sinhalese consider a marriage
between the father’s sister’s son and the mother’s brother’s daughter
the most proper that they can contract; but they would regard a
marriage with the father’s brother’s daughter as incestuous, first
cousins so related being considered sisters.[1814]

As regards the prohibited degrees of the Chinese Penal Code, a very
minute account is given by Mr. Medhurst in his interesting paper on
‘Marriage, Affinity, and Inheritance in China.’[1815] Large bodies
of persons in that country bear the same surname; among the entire
Chinese population of the Empire, indeed, there are hardly more
than 530 surnames. A penalty of sixty blows is inflicted on any one
who marries a person with the same surname.[1816] The punishment
attached to the intermarriage of nearer relations on the father’s
side is much more severe. Thus, marriage or incestuous intercourse
with a grand-uncle, a father’s first cousin, a brother, or a nephew,
is punishable by death.[1817] Besides these prohibitions there are
others applying within a narrower range to relatives on the female
side. A man who marries his mother’s sister or his sister’s daughter
is strangled. Less severe punishment is inflicted on a person who
marries a uterine half-sister, and still less severe—eighty blows—on
any one who marries his father’s sister’s daughter, mother’s brother’s
daughter, or mother’s sister’s daughter. An after-clause abrogates this
prohibition, and permits intermarriage between children of brothers and
sisters, or of sisters, but intermarriage between those of brothers
is of course inadmissible.[1818] The Chinese Code also interdicts
occasional intercourse with any of those relatives with whom marriage
is prohibited, the punishment in both cases being the same.[1819]

Among the Kalmucks, no man can marry a relation on the father’s side;
and so deeply rooted is this custom among them, that a Kalmuck proverb
says, “The great folk and dogs know no relationship,”—alluding to the
fact that only a prince may marry a relative.[1820] The Yakuts,[1821]
Samoyedes,[1822] Cheremises,[1823] &c., also avoid marriage within
the paternal clan, and the ancient Finns did not marry kinsfolk.[1824]
Among the Ostyaks[1825] and Ossetes,[1826] marriage with a person
of one’s own family name, however distant the relationship, is
entirely prohibited. And in Circassia, according to Bell, not only
are cousins, or the members of the same fraternity restricted from
intermarrying, but even their serfs must wed with the serfs of another
fraternity.[1827]

Among the Bogos of Eastern Africa, persons related within the seventh
degree may not intermarry, whether the relationship be on the paternal
or maternal side.[1828] Some of the clans of the Somals, as we are
informed by Sir R. F. Burton, refuse maidens of the same or even a
consanguineous family.[1829] In Western Equatorial Africa and Uganda,
marriages cannot take place within the clans, however remote the
relationship may be.[1830] Among the Mpongwé, “every care is taken to
avoid marriages of consanguinity.”[1831] With the Bateke, as Dr. Sims
writes from Stanley Pool, marriages are prohibited between brothers and
sisters of the same mother or father; between first cousins; between
uncle and niece, or aunt and nephew. The Bakongo also, according to Mr.
Ingham, hold all unions between near relatives, either on the father’s
or mother’s side, in utter abomination.

Mr. Cousins, to whom I am indebted for a valuable paper on the
Cis-Natalian Kafirs, writes that, among them, marriages often take
place within the tribe and village. But this is avoided, if possible;
like their chiefs they generally endeavour to marry out of their own
tribe. Among this people, however, there is some kind of class (clan?)
division, which Mr. Cousins is not fully acquainted with, and members
of the same class (clan?) do not seem to intermarry. At any rate, near
relations, paternal and maternal, avoid marriage with each other. No
penalty is attached to such a marriage, but custom is so strong on
the point that the general rule is seldom broken.[1832] According to
Mr. Shooter[1833] and Mr. Dugmore,[1834] a marriage is considered
incestuous if the man and woman are of any known or remembered degree
of relationship by common descent; and, if a man were to take a wife
within the degrees prohibited by custom, he would be denounced as an
“evildoer.”[1835] According to Mr. Brownlee, intercourse in such cases
is punished, whether it be by marriage or without marriage.[1836]
Again, with regard to the Zulus, Mr. Eyles states that there is no
intermarriage between the inhabitants of the village, the members of
which are, as a rule, related. All intermarrying with relations is
prohibited by custom, and such a thing is neither heard of nor thought
of. Even if the relationship is only traditional, the custom holds good.

A somewhat different account of the Bantu race is given by Mr.
McCall Theal. “A native of the coast region,” he says, “will not
marry a girl whose relationship by blood to himself can be traced,
no matter how distantly connected they may be. So scrupulous is he
in this respect that he will not marry even a girl who belongs to
another tribe, if she has the same family name as himself, though the
relationship cannot be traced. He regards himself as the protector of
those females whom he would term his cousins and second cousins, but
for whom he has only the same name as for the daughters of his own
parents, the endearing name of sister. In his opinion, union with one
of them would be incestuous, something horrible, something unutterably
disgraceful. The native of the mountains, almost as a rule, marries the
daughter of his father’s brother.”[1837]

Mr. Conder states that, among the Bechuanas, marrying out of their own
tribe seems to be the common practice;[1838] whereas, according to Mr.
Casalis, the Basutos frequently marry cousins. Yet, among them also,
there are some tribes who consider such marriages incestuous.[1839]
The Hottentots are said by Kolben to punish alliances between first
and second cousins with death.[1840] In Madagascar, though marriage
between brothers’ children is looked upon as the most proper kind
of connection, and brothers’ and sisters’ children can marry on the
performance of a slight but prescribed ceremony, supposed to remove
any impediment or disqualification arising out of consanguinity, the
descendants of sisters are not allowed to intermarry down to the fifth
or seventh generation, and a marriage of sisters’ children, when the
sisters have the same mother, is regarded with horror.[1841]

Among the Romans, alliances between persons under the same _patria
potestas_—_i.e._, _cognati_ related within the sixth degree—were
_nefariæ et incestuæ nuptiæ_; but these prohibitions were gradually
relaxed. From the time of the Second Punic War, according to Livy,
even first cousins were allowed to intermarry; and in 49 A.D. the
Emperor Claudius, wishing to marry his niece Agrippina, obtained from
the Senate a decree that marriage with a brother’s daughter should be
legal, though marriage with a sister’s daughter remained illegal.[1842]
In the fourth century, however, Constantius again forbade such unions,
on pain of death.[1843] Afterwards, under the influence of the ascetic
ideas prevalent in the Church, the prohibited degrees were gradually
extended. Theodosius the Great forbade under the severest penalties the
union of first cousins, paternal and maternal; and at the end of the
sixth century the prohibition was extended even to the seventh degree.
This prohibition continued in force until in the Western Church it was
once more reduced to the fourth degree by the Lateran Council under
Innocent III. in the year 1215; that is, marriage was permitted beyond
the degree of third cousins.[1844] Such is the nominal law at the
present time wherever the canon law prevails.[1845]

Besides the prohibitions relating to actual kinship, there are, among
several peoples, others applying to marriage between relatives by
alliance. Among the Andamanese, a man or woman may not marry into
the family of a brother-in-law or sister-in-law.[1846] The Eastern
Greenlanders and the Eskimo of the north-east coast of America forbid
or disapprove of marriage with two sisters;[1847] and, according to
Dr. Daniell, the same rule prevails among the natives of Accra at
the Gold Coast, who even prohibit a man from marrying two cousins of
the same parentage.[1848] Again, several tribes in Western Victoria
do not permit marriage with a deceased wife’s daughter by a former
husband.[1849] But prohibitions of this sort do not seem to be very
common among savage and barbarous races. In many of the Indian tribes
of North America, all the daughters of a family are, as a rule, married
to the same man. A brother very frequently marries his deceased
brother’s widow; and, in Africa, a son often weds all his father’s
widows except his own mother.

Among civilized peoples, on the other hand, relations by affinity
are frequently regarded in the same light as relations by blood. In
Yucatan, a man was not allowed to marry his sister-in-law.[1850]
According to the Chinese Code, marriage with a deceased brother’s
widow is punished with strangulation, whilst marriage with a deceased
wife’s sister is exceedingly common, and has always been regarded
as particularly honourable.[1851] In Japan, intercourse with a
father’s or a grandfather’s concubine, or a son’s or grandson’s wife,
involves the same punishment as intercourse with a paternal aunt or
a sister.[1852] The ‘Institutes of Vishnu’ declare that “sexual
connection with one’s mother, or daughter, or daughter-in-law, are
crimes in the highest degree,” there being no other way to atone for
these crimes than to proceed into the flames.[1853] According to the
laws of Moses[1854] and Mohammed[1855] and the Roman Law[1856] marriage
was prohibited with mother-in-law, step-mother, daughter-in-law,
and step-daughter—according to Mohammed, however, so far as the
step-daughter was concerned, only if she were under the guardianship of
her mother’s husband. Moses also forbade marriage with the sister of
a wife who was still living,[1857] and with a brother’s wife, if she
were widowed and had children by the brother; and Mohammed prohibited
marriage with two sisters at the same time.

       *       *       *       *       *

From very early times thinkers have tried to account for the
prohibition of marriage between near kin. Some, says Mr. Huth, ascribe
them to a fear lest relationship may become too involved; others to a
fear lest affection may become concentrated within too narrow a circle;
because marriage would take place too early; because people would be
induced to marry each other in order that property might be kept in the
family; because such marriages are prohibited by “God’s law”; because
they outrage “natural modesty”; and, only in modern times, because
they are supposed to prove injurious to the offspring.[1858]

Comparative ethnography has changed the aspect of the question. The
horror of incest has been found to prevail among peoples who neither
know anything of “God’s law,” nor possess property to keep in the
family. New hypotheses have therefore been suggested more worthy of
consideration, as being founded on a much firmer basis of facts.

The late Mr. McLennan was the first to call attention to the general
prevalence of the rule which forbids the members of a tribe (or clan)
to intermarry with members of their own tribe (or clan). This rule
he called “exogamy,” in contradistinction to “endogamy,” or the
rule which forbids the members of a tribe to intermarry with members
of other tribes. In his celebrated essay on ‘Primitive Marriage’
he made an attempt to show that exogamy had arisen from female
infanticide, “common among savages everywhere.” He assumes that to
tribes surrounded by enemies, and unaided by art, contending with the
difficulties of subsistence, sons were a source of strength, both for
defence and in the quest for food, whilst daughters were a source of
weakness. Hence the cruel custom which left the primitive human hordes
with very few young women, thus seriously disturbing the balance of
the sexes within the hordes, and forcing them to prey upon one another
for wives. Usage, induced by necessity, would then in time establish
a prejudice among the tribes observing it—a prejudice strong as a
principle of religion, as every prejudice relating to marriage is apt
to be—against marrying women of their own tribe.[1859]

Mr. Herbert Spencer has subjected this hypothesis to a searching
criticism,[1860] and from an article in the ‘Fortnightly Review’ it
appears as if Mr. McLennan himself had in the end some doubts as to its
correctness.[1861] To Mr. Spencer’s objections others might be added.

A minute investigation of the extent to which female infanticide is
practised has convinced me that Mr. McLennan has much exaggerated the
importance of this custom. It certainly prevails in many parts of the
world; and it is true that, as a rule, female children are killed
rather than male. But there is nothing to indicate that infanticide
has ever been so nearly universal, or has anywhere been practised on
so large a scale as Mr. McLennan’s hypothesis presupposes. Among a
great many existing savage peoples it is almost unheard of—as, for
instance, among the Tuski,[1862] Ahts,[1863] Western Eskimo,[1864]
Botocudos,[1865] and in certain tribes of California.[1866] Among some
of these peoples new-born children are killed now and then—in case
of the birth of twins, if the children are weak and deformed, or for
some other reason—but always, it is said, without distinction of sex.
Among the Dacotahs and Crees, female infanticide is only occasionally
committed.[1867] The Blackfeet, according to Richardson, believe that
women who have been guilty of this crime will never reach the happy
mountain after death, but are compelled to hover round the seats
of their crimes, with branches of trees tied to their legs;[1868]
and the Aleuts think that a child-murder brings misfortune on the
whole village.[1869] Among the Abipones, the women often practised
infanticide, but it was the boy who was generally thus sacrificed, for
when a son grew up it was necessary to buy a wife for him, while a
grown-up daughter would always command her price.[1870]

In Africa I do not know of a single district where the people are in
the habit of destroying new-born children. Herr Valdau tells us of a
Bakundu woman who, accused of such a deed, was condemned to death.[1871]

Until the introduction of Christianity, the South Sea Islanders
practised infanticide probably to a greater extent than any other
people with whose history we are acquainted. But as the motive was
often want of food for the infant, or interference with the personal
charms of the wife, or the disagreeableness of baby life, boys as
well as girls were killed. Moreover, in Samoa, in the Mitchell’s and
Hervey Groups, and in part of New Guinea, infanticide was quite unheard
of;[1872] whilst, in most of the islands belonging to the Solomon
Group, it occurs only in extreme cases, such as that of the child being
a bastard.[1873] In the Caroline Islands, according to Chamisso, “the
prince would have the unnatural mother punished with death.”[1874]
And even in Australia, where, according to Mr. Curr’s belief, the
women reared as a rule, only two boys and one girl, the rest being
destroyed,[1875] there seem to be tribes in which the killing of
children rarely happens.[1876]

There are other reasons, besides those just given, for doubting whether
infanticide can ever have been so common as Mr. McLennan suggests. It
may be assumed, as Mr. Darwin remarks, that during the earliest period
of human development man did not partially lose one of the strongest of
instincts, common to all the lower animals, namely the love of their
young, and consequently did not practise infanticide.[1877] Later
on, the women, far from being useless to the savage tribe, rendered
valuable services as food-providers. Mr. Fison, who has lived among
uncivilized races for many years, thinks it will be found that female
infanticide is far less common among the lower savages than it is
among the more advanced tribes.[1878] And, speaking of one of the
very rudest, the Yahgans of Tierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges states that
it occurred only occasionally among them, and then was almost always
the deed of the mother, who acted from “jealousy, or hatred of her
husband, or because of desertion and wretchedness.”[1879] Moreover, it
is very generally asserted that certain Californians never committed
infanticide before the arrival of the whites;[1880] whilst Ellis thinks
that there is every reason to suppose that this custom was practised
less extensively by the Polynesians during the early periods of their
history than it was afterwards.[1881]

But even if Mr. McLennan were right in his assumption that savages
everywhere used to kill female infants, this would not explain the
origin of exogamy. “In time,” he says, “it came to be considered
improper, because it was unusual, for a man to marry a woman of his
own group.”[1882] But why should such a marriage ever have become
unusual? Why should the men have refrained from marrying those women
of their own tribe who were not killed? Why should they have made
these beings whom they considered so useless, even more useless than
they naturally were, by preventing them from becoming mothers of sons
who would have increased the strength of the tribe? That the men may
have endeavoured to make up the deficiency of women by capturing wives
from foreign tribes is conceivable enough; but it is hard to see why
intercourse with women of their own tribe should on this account have
been prohibited, sometimes even on pain of death.

That the horror of incest is innate in the human race seems as
improbable to Mr. Herbert Spencer as to Mr. McLennan. According to Mr.
Spencer, this feeling is a result of evolution gradually acquired.
Primitive groups of men, he says, are habitually hostile. In all
times and places victory is followed by pillage; whatever portable
things of worth the conquerors find they take. And of course they take
women as they take other booty, because women are prized as wives, as
concubines, or as drudges. A captured woman, besides her intrinsic
value, has an extrinsic value: “like a native wife she serves as a
slave, but unlike a native wife, she serves also as a trophy.” Hence
members of the tribe thus married to foreign women are held to be
more honourably married than those married to native women. If the
tribe, becoming successful in war, robs adjacent tribes of their
women more frequently, there will then grow up the idea that the now
considerable class having foreign wives form the honourable class, and
non-possession of a foreign wife will come to be regarded as a proof of
cowardice. “An increasing ambition to get foreign wives will therefore
arise; and as the number of those who are without them decreases, the
brand of disgrace attaching to them will grow more decided; until in
the most warlike tribes, it becomes an imperative requirement that a
wife shall be obtained from another tribe—if not in open war, then by
private abduction.”[1883]

This interpretation is open to an objection similar to that which
may be brought against Mr. McLennan’s hypothesis. Even if it became
customary for a tribe to rob foreign tribes of their women, we have
no reason to believe that it therefore became customary not to marry
native women. Plurality of wives is for savage man a source of wealth
and reputation; even the wretched Fuegian endeavours to procure as
many as possible in order to obtain rowers for his canoe. Hence it
could scarcely be considered disgraceful to have some native wives
besides those of foreign birth. If Mr. Spencer’s explanation is the
correct one, what a deplorable lot it must have been for a woman to
belong to a tribe always successful in war! She had of course to live
unmarried till she was fortunate enough to fall into the hands of some
hostile suitor. But this would seldom happen, if the adjacent weaker
tribes were habitually worsted in war. In such tribes, according to
Mr. Spencer, “marrying within the tribe will not only be habitual,
but there will arise a prejudice, and eventually a law, against taking
wives from other tribes.”[1884]

Least of all can Mr. Spencer’s hypothesis explain the origin of
prohibitions of marriage between the nearest kin. It presupposes that
the tribe has been frequently successful in war during so long a period
that usage has had time to grow into law. But since such prohibitions
are practically common to all mankind, they cannot have originated
in the way suggested, because when there is a vanquisher there must
also be a vanquished. Moreover, it is impossible to suppose that that
powerful feeling which restrains parents from marrying their children,
brothers from marrying their sisters, can have been due to man’s vain
desire to have a trophy in his wife.[1885]

Sir John Lubbock explains the origin of exogamy in a quite different
way. Believing that in man’s primitive state all the men of a tribe
were married to all the women, and that no one could appropriate one of
them to himself without infringing on the general rights of the tribe,
he suggests that women taken in war from a foreign tribe were in a
different position. The tribe, as a tribe, had no right to these women,
and they would become wives in our sense of the term.[1886]

It is unnecessary to say much about this hypothesis, as it stands or
falls with Sir J. Lubbock’s theory of “communal marriage.” Why should
women taken in war have been the men’s personal property, if the women
of the tribe were not so? As Mr. McLennan justly remarks, war-captives
are usually obtained by group-acts, or quasi group-acts; hence capture
would be recognized as a regular mode of adding women to the group,
subject to the customary rights of its male members; and every man in
the group would claim the communal right to women taken by others.[1887]

Again, Professor Kohler has expressed his belief in the explanation
that exogamy was an early method of political self-preservation.[1888]
That intermarriage is valuable from a political point of view, and has
often taken place in order to increase intertribal or international
friendship, is beyond doubt.[1889] But it is another question whether
the strictly prohibitive exogamous rules, the infringement of which
is considered a most heinous crime, can be accounted for in this way.
It is worth noticing that not only marriage, but also less regular
connections between members of the same exogamous group are held in
horror. The Australians, for instance, consider cohabitation between
individuals belonging to clans that cannot intermarry not less
criminal than marriage, often punishing such unions with death.[1890]
Among the Melanesians, says Dr. Codrington, “intercourse within the
limit which restrains from marriage, where two members of the same
division are concerned, is a crime, is incest.”[1891] Holm makes
a similar observation on the prohibited degrees among the Eastern
Greenlanders.[1892] Speaking of the Samoans, Mr. Prichard remarks,
“Of all their customs, the most strictly observed, perhaps, was that
which forbade the remotest reference to anything, even by way of a
joke, that conveyed the slightest indelicacy in thought or word or
gesture, when brothers and sisters were together. In presence of his
sister, the wildest rake was always modest and moral. In presence
of her brother, the most accommodating _coquette_ was always chaste
and reserved. This custom remains intact to the present day.”[1893]
Dr. Tylor remarks that anthropologists have long had before them the
problem of determining how far clan-exogamy may have been the origin
of the prohibited degrees in matrimony.[1894] But we have seen that it
is practically impossible to trace any distinct limit between these
two sets of rules; hence they seem to be fundamentally identical—a
conclusion in which most anthropologists agree. And the prohibitions
of close intermarriage certainly cannot be explained as a “method of
political self-preservation.”

Other writers—and among them Mr. Morgan—have suggested that
prohibitions of the marriage of near kin have arisen from observation
of the injurious results of such unions.[1895] But most investigators
who have considered the subject believe that this knowledge could be
gained only by lengthened observation, and, to quote Dr. Peschel, is
“unattainable by unsettled and childishly heedless races,” among whom,
nevertheless, a horror of incest is developed most strongly.[1896] Sir
Henry Maine, on the other hand, thinks that the men who discovered
the use of fire and selected the wild forms of certain animals for
domestication and of vegetables for cultivation, might also have been
able to find out that children of unsound constitution were born
of nearly related parents.[1897] In the next chapter, I shall have
occasion to mention some instances which possibly may point in this
direction, but in no case does such knowledge appear to be generally
diffused among backward races. Mr. Curr has been unable to discover on
what ground consanguineous marriages are held to be objectionable by
the Australians, their replies to questions on this head invariably
being, “Our tribe always did as we do in this matter.” Yet they are
well aware, he says, that the aim of the exogamous restrictions is
to prevent the union of nearly related individuals.[1898] Dr. Sims
writes that no other reason for the avoidance of marriage between near
relations has been stated to him by the indigenous Bateke than that of
“shame.” Mr. Bridges informs me that the Yahgans point simply to the
fact of relationship as the reason; and, when Azara asked the Charruas
why a brother and sister never intermarried, they replied that they
did not know why.[1899] It is conceivable that the experience of the
injurious results of such marriages, once acquired, might afterwards
have fallen into oblivion, although the prohibition continued to exist.
But Azara expressly states that the Charruas have no law forbidding
incestuous alliances, yet he has never seen nor heard of any among them.

Whatever observations may have been made, the prohibition of incest is
in no case founded on experience. Had the savage man discerned that
children born of marriage between closely related persons are not so
sound and vigorous as others, he would scarcely have allowed this
knowledge to check his passions. Considering how seldom a civilised
man who has any disease, or tendency to disease, which is likely to be
transmitted to his descendants, hesitates to marry an equally unhealthy
woman, it would surely be unreasonable to suppose that savages have
greater forethought and self-command.[1900] But even if we admit
that man originally avoided marriage with near kin from sagacious
calculation, and that he did this during so long a period that usage
grew into law, we do not advance a step further. All the writers whose
hypotheses have been considered in this chapter, assume that men avoid
incestuous marriages only because they are _taught_ to do so. “It
is probable,” says Mr. Huth, “that, if brothers and sisters were
allowed to marry, they would do so while yet too young.”[1901] But
though law and custom may prevent passion from passing into action,
they cannot wholly destroy its inward power. Law may forbid a son to
marry his mother, a brother his sister, but it could not prevent him
from desiring such a union if the desire were natural. Where does
that appetite exist? The home is kept pure from incestuous defilement
neither by laws, nor by customs, nor by education, but by an _instinct_
which under normal circumstances makes sexual love between the nearest
kin a psychical impossibility. An unwritten law, says Plato, defends
“as sufficiently as possible,” parents from incestuous intercourse
with their children, brothers from intercourse with their sisters:
“ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἐπιθυμία ταύτης τῆς συνουσίας τὸ παρ ‘παν εἰσέρχεται τοὺς
πολλοὺς”—“nor does even the desire for this intercourse come at all
upon the masses.”[1902]




CHAPTER XV

PROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN KINDRED

(_Concluded_)


It has been asserted that, if there be really an innate horror of
incest, it ought to show itself intuitively when persons are ignorant
of any relationship. But ancient writers state that, in Rome,
incestuous unions often resulted from the exposure of infants who were
reared by slave-dealers. Not long ago Selim Pasha unwittingly married
his sister, who, like himself, had been a Circassian slave. The story
told in the ‘Heptameron’ of a double incest was probably true, and
became widely spread; and so on. Man has thus no horror of marriage
with even the nearest kindred if he is unaware of their consanguinity;
consequently, Mr. Huth concludes, there is no innate feeling against
incest.[1903]

Of course I agree with Mr. Huth in thinking that there is no innate
aversion to marriage with _near relations_. What I maintain is, that
there is an innate aversion to sexual intercourse between persons
living very closely together from early youth, and that, as such
persons are in most cases related, this feeling displays itself chiefly
as a horror of intercourse between near kin.

The existence of an innate aversion of this kind has been taken
by various writers as a psychological fact proved by common
experience;[1904] and it seems impossible otherwise to explain the
feeling which makes the relationships between parents and children,
and brothers and sisters, so free from all sexual excitement. But the
chief evidence is afforded by an abundance of ethnographical facts
which prove that it is not, in the first place, by the degrees of
consanguinity, but by the close living together that prohibitory laws
against intermarriage are determined.

Egede asserts that, among the Greenlanders, it would be reckoned
uncouth and blamable, if a lad and a girl who had served and been
educated in one family, desired to be married to one another;[1905]
and, according to Dr. Nansen, it is preferred that the contracting
parties should belong to different settlements.[1906] Colonel
Macpherson states that, among the Kandhs, marriage cannot take place
even with strangers who have been long adopted into, or domesticated
with, a tribe.[1907] And Mr. Cousins writes to me that the Cis-Natalian
Kafirs dislike marriage between persons who live very closely together,
whether related or not. In the Northern New Hebrides, a girl betrothed
in childhood is sometimes taken to her future father-in-law’s house and
brought up there. Dr. Codrington says that “the boy often thinks she
is his sister, and is much ashamed when he comes to know the relation
in which he stands.”[1908]

Many peoples have a rule of exogamy that does not depend on kinship
at all. Piedrahita relates of the Panches of Bogota that the men and
women of one town did not intermarry, as they held themselves to be
brothers and sisters, and the impediment of kinship was sacred to them;
but such was their ignorance that, if a sister were born in a different
town from her brother, he was not prevented from marrying her.[1909]
The Yaméos, on the river Amazons, will not suffer an intermarriage
between members of the same community, “as being friends in blood,
though no real affinity between them can be proved.”[1910] The Uaupés,
according to Mr. Wallace, “do not often marry with relations, or
even neighbours, preferring those from a distance, or even from
other tribes.”[1911] The Australian tribe, as Mr. Howitt points out,
is organized in two ways. On the one hand, it is divided socially
into phratries and clans; and, on the other hand, it is divided
geographically into hordes. The two organizations are co-existent, but
the divisions of the one do not correspond with those of the other.
For while all the people who belong to any given local group are found
in one locality alone, those who belong to any given social group are
to be found distributed among many, if not among all, of the local
groups. Now, in many tribes, local proximity by birth is quite an
insuperable obstacle to marriage, a man being absolutely forbidden to
marry, or have sexual intercourse with, a woman of the same horde or
sub-horde. “However eligible she may be in other respects,” says Mr.
Howitt, “the fact that both parties belong to the same locality is
held by certain tribes, the Kurnai, for example, to make them ‘too near
each other.’” It is chiefly in tribes where the clan-system has been
weakened, or has become almost extinct, that the local organization
has assumed such overwhelming preponderance, but even in some of
the tribes which have a vigorous clan-system, local restraints upon
marriage are strictly enforced.[1912] In Sumatra, according to Mr.
Forbes, the country was originally divided into native districts
called “margas,” each marga, as a rule, having its several villages.
Each of these village communities is a collection of families, either
related or not to each other by the ties of blood;[1913] and we
know that, at least among certain tribes, marriage between members
of the same village or village cluster, and in some districts even
between those of the same marga, is prohibited.[1914] The Kotars of
the Neilgherries,[1915] Galela,[1916] Fijians,[1917] Zulus,[1918]
Wakamba,[1919] and Kamchadales[1920] avoid, as a rule, marriage with
members of the same village. So also do the Nogai, who consider it most
honest for a man to marry a woman whom he has never seen before.[1921]
In various of the smaller islands belonging to the Indian Archipelago,
according to Riedel, women prefer marriage with strangers.[1922] The
Assamese have a national festival named the “Baisakh Bihu,” which is
as gay as a carnival, the women, and especially the maidens, enjoying
unusual liberty as long as it lasts. “For many days before the actual
festival,” says Colonel Dalton, “the young people in the villages may
be seen moving about in groups gaily dressed or forming circles, in the
midst of which the prettiest girls dance with their long hair loose on
their shoulders.” But on these occasions the girls “do not like to
dance before the men of their own village.”[1923] Professor Kovalevsky
observes that, in some parts of Russia, the bride is always taken from
another village than the bridegroom’s; and, even in provinces in which
no similar custom is known to exist, “the bridegroom is constantly
spoken of as a foreigner (‘choujoy,’ ‘choujaninin’), and his friends
and attendants are represented as coming with him from a distant
country, in order to take away the future spouse.”[1924] Sir Richard
Burton says, “As a general rule Somali women prefer _amourettes_
with strangers, following the well-known Arab proverb, ‘The new comer
filleth the eye.’”[1925]

We have seen how variously defined the prohibited degrees are in the
laws of nations. Facts show that the extent to which relatives are
not allowed to intermarry is nearly connected with their close living
together. Generally speaking, the prohibited degrees are extended much
farther among savage and barbarous peoples than in civilized societies.
As a rule, the former, if they have not remained in the most primitive
social condition of man, live, not in separate families, but in large
households or communities, all the members of which dwell in very close
contact with each other.

The communism in the family life of the exogamous Indians of North
America has been exhaustively illustrated by Mr. Morgan in his work on
‘Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines.’ “The household of
the Mandans,” he says, “consisting of from twenty to forty persons,
the households of the Columbian tribes of about the same number, the
Soshonee household of seven families, the households of the Sauks, of
the Iroquois, and of the Creeks, each composed of several families,
are fair types of the households of the Northern Indians at the epoch
of their discovery. The fact is also established that these tribes
constructed, as a rule, large joint tenement houses, each of which was
occupied by a large household composed of several families, among whom
provisions were in common, and who practised communism in living in the
household.”[1926] Among the Iroquois, each household was made up on
the principle of kinship through females, so that the married women,
usually sisters, own or collateral, being of the same gens or clan,
together with their children made a family circle, within which, as we
have seen, intermarriage was entirely prohibited.[1927] The Senel in
California live sometimes from twenty to thirty together in the same
immense dome-shaped or oblong lodge of willow-poles, including all
who are blood relations.[1928] According to Egede, the Greenlanders,
who prohibit marriage between cousins, continue after marriage to
live in their parents’ house together with other kindred; and what
they get they all enjoy in common.[1929] The Chippewas, who consider
cousins german in the same light as brothers and sisters, but do not
recognize relationship beyond this degree, are divided into small bands
consisting of but few families each.[1930] Among the exogamous Uaupés,
the houses are the abode of numerous families, and sometimes of a whole
horde.[1931] Among the Yahgans, who regard marriage between first and
second cousins as incestuous, “occasionally as many as five families
are to be found living in a wigwam, but generally two families.”[1932]

The Australian aborigines live mostly in small hordes, often consisting
of from thirty to fifty men, women, and children. Such a horde,
according to Mr. Brough Smyth, “is in fact but an enlargement of
a family circle, and none within it can intermarry.”[1933] Among
the Efatese, in whose clan-system the prohibition of incest is a
fundamental law, each clan is regarded as one family. “A child of
_a_,” says Mr. Macdonald, “calls her own mother mother, and all
her mother’s tribe (clan) sisters mother; and calls by the name of
father not only her own father but all his tribe (clan) brothers; and
they all call the child their child.”[1934] The Malays, according
to Professor Wilken, live, as a rule, in large houses containing a
great number of differently related persons.[1935] “In Nanusa,”
Dr. Hickson remarks, “I understood that marriage was not permitted
between members of the same household. The enormous households of the
Nanusa archipelago are probably the remnants of a much more complete
system of intra-tribal clanships, which has become almost obliterated
in the more highly developed races of Sangir and Siauw.”[1936] Among
the Nairs, a household, the members of which are strictly prohibited
from sexual relation with each other, includes, as a rule, many allied
men, women, and children, who not only live together in large common
houses, but possess everything in common.[1937] Among the Kafirs, the
dimensions of a kraal are determined by the number of a man’s family
and dependants, the family consisting of the father together with his
children, including married sons.[1938]

The South Slavonians live in house-communities, each consisting
of a body of from fifteen to sixty members or even more, who are
blood-relations to the second or third degree, of course only on
the male side.[1939] These related families associate in a common
dwelling or group of dwellings, governed by a common chief. “At the
present moment,” Sir Henry Maine remarks, “the common residence of
so many persons of both sexes in the same household may be said to
be only possible through their belief that any union of kinsmen and
kinswomen would be incestuous. The South Slavonian table of prohibited
degrees is extremely wide.”[1940] Again, Professor Kohler points out
the connection between the extensive prohibitions of the Hindus and
their large households.[1941] In Wales there existed, as a national
institution, a joint-family called “trev,” consisting of four
generations. Marriage, says Mr. Lewis, was to be “outside the trev, or
kindred who lived together within one enclosure.”[1942]

Montesquieu, indeed, observed long ago that marriage between cousins
was prohibited by peoples among whom brothers and their children used
to live in the same house. “Chez ces peuples,” he says, “le mariage
entre cousins germains doit être regardé comme contraire à la nature;
chez les autres, non.” According to him, this prohibition has the
same origin as the aversion to sexual relations between brothers and
sisters, _i.e._, “les pères et les mères ayent voulu conserver les
mœurs de leurs enfans et leurs maisons pures.”[1943] Holding a similar
opinion, Dr. Bertillon maintains that, properly speaking, it was not
consanguinity, but the purity of home, that the ancient legislators
were thinking of when they forbade close intermarriage.[1944] It
is scarcely necessary to say how far I am from thinking that these
prohibitions are, in the first place, due to the providence of parents
or legislators.

On the other hand, where the families live more separately such
extensive prohibitions to close intermarrying do not generally
exist. Among the Isánna Indians of Brazil, who prefer marriage with
relations, cousins with cousins, uncles with nieces, and nephews
with aunts, each family has a separate house.[1945] The endogamous
Maoris, who frequently marry near relations, have their villages
generally scattered over a large plot of ground, the personal rights
of possession being held most sacred.[1946] “There is no national
bond of union amongst them,” says Mr. Yate; “each one is jealous of
the authority and power of his neighbour; the hand of each individual
is against every man, and every man’s hand against him.”[1947] Among
the Todas, who live in strict endogamy, families reside in permanent
villages having each a certain tract of grazing ground around it,
and containing from two to three huts. Most of these huts consist of
only one room or cabin, and each room holds one entire subdivision of
a family.[1948] The Bushmans, among whom no degree of consanguinity
prevents a matrimonial connection, except between brothers and sisters,
parents and children,[1949] live a solitary life in small family huts,
not high enough to admit even of a Bushman standing upright within
it.[1950] As regards the Wanyoro, whose table of prohibited degrees is
unusually small, Emin Pasha states, “Brother, sister, brother-in-law,
and son-in-law, are the recognized grades of relationship. I have never
noticed any intimate connection between more distant relations.”[1951]

The Sinhalese, who frequently marry their cousins on the paternal
side, have from time immemorial lived either in very small villages,
consisting of a few houses, or in detached habitations, separated from
each other. Each dwelling is a little establishment in itself, and each
little village, so far as its wants are concerned, may be considered
independent. “They seldom visit each other, except it be to beg or
borrow something. Even near relations manifest no affection to each
other in their visits, but sit with the gravity of strangers.”[1952]

It is easy to explain, says Ewald, why, among the Hebrews, marriage
between brothers and sisters in the widest sense was forbidden, while
that between cousins was permitted:—“The latter did not form one
united household, and the more each house stood strictly by itself
in the ancient fashion, the wider seemed the separation between
cousins.”[1953] Tacitus states that the ancient Germans, whose
prohibitions against incest seem to have included only the nearest
relations, lived in scattered families at some distance from each
other.[1954] And a comparison between the forbidden degrees of the
Greeks and Romans clearly shows where we have to seek the real cause
of the prohibitions. Among the former, even very close relationship
was no hindrance to intermarriage, whereas, among the latter, it was
not allowed between rather distantly related persons. This difference,
as Rossbach justly points out, was due to the fact that the family
feeling of the Greeks was much weaker than that of the Romans, among
whom, in early times, a son used to remain in his father’s house even
after marriage, so that cousins on the father’s side were brought up
as brothers and sisters. Later on, the several families separated from
the common household, and the prohibited degrees were considerably
retrenched.[1955]

The reader may perhaps be disposed to reproach me for selecting only
such instances as are in favour of my theory; but statistical data
will show that such an imputation would be groundless. In speaking of
the “classificatory system of relationship,” I pointed out that this
system springs, to a great extent, from the close living together
of considerable numbers of kinsfolk. Now it is most interesting to
note that Dr. Tylor, by his method of adhesions, has found the two
institutions, exogamy and classificatory relationship, to be in fact
two sides of one institution. “In reckoning,” he says, “from the
present schedules the number of peoples who use relationship names more
or less corresponding to the classificatory systems here considered,
they are found to be fifty-three, and the estimated number of these
which might coincide accidentally with exogamy, were there no close
connection between them, would be about twelve. But in fact the number
of peoples who have both exogamy and classification is thirty-three,
this strong coincidence being the measure of the close casual
connection subsisting between the two institutions. The adherence is
even stronger as to cross-cousin marriage (_i.e._, that the children
of two brothers may not marry, nor the children of two sisters, though
the child of the brother may marry the child of the sister), of which
twenty-one cases appear in the schedules, no less than fifteen of the
peoples practising it being also known as exogamous.”[1956] Among
the Reddies, a father’s elder brother and a mother’s elder sister
are called, respectively, “great-father” and “great mother,” and a
father’s younger brother and a mother’s younger sister, respectively,
“lesser-father” and “lesser mother”; whereas the father’s sisters and
the mother’s brothers are denoted by quite different terms. Mr. Kearns
remarks that they consider the difference as well as the distance of
relationship between these two groups of relations to be so great
that they think it unlawful and incestuous to marry the daughter of a
father’s brother or of a mother’s sister, she being equal to a sister,
whilst it is perfectly legal to marry the daughter of a father’s sister
or of a mother’s brother.[1957]

We have seen that the prohibitions against incest are very often more
or less one-sided, applying more extensively either to the relations
on the father’s side or to those on the mother’s, according as descent
is reckoned through men or women. We have also seen that the line
of descent is intimately connected with local relationships; and
we may now fairly infer that the same local relationships exercise
a considerable influence on the table of prohibited degrees. Among
the Rejangs of Sumatra, says Marsden, a marriage must not take place
between relations within the third degree; “but there are exceptions
for the descendants of females who, passing into other families, become
as strangers.”[1958] A Chinese woman, on marriage, alienates herself
from her own family to be incorporated into that of her husband;
hence, as Mr. Medhurst observes, children of brothers and sisters may
marry at pleasure, while those of brothers cannot be united on pain of
death.[1959]

In a large number of cases, prohibitions of intermarriage are only
indirectly influenced by the close living together. Aversion to the
intermarriage of persons who live in intimate connection with each
other has provoked prohibitions of the intermarriage of relations; and,
as kinship is traced by means of a system of names, the name comes to
be considered identical with relationship. This system, as Dr. Tylor
remarks,[1960] is necessarily one-sided. Though it will keep up the
record of descent either on the male or female side, it cannot do both
at once. The other line, not having been kept up by such means of
record, even where it is recognized as a line of relationship, is more
or less neglected, and is soon forgotten; hence the prohibited degrees
often extend very far on the one side, but not on the other. We have
seen many instances of a common surname being a bar to intermarriage.
This is especially the case with peoples among whom the clannish
feeling is highly developed. Thus even the commonest Chinese are often
able to trace their descent through lines of ancestry more remote than
any that England’s most ancient families can claim.[1961] And, among
the Ossetes, a man is bound to take blood-revenge for a cousin a
hundred times removed who bears his name, whereas relationship on the
mother’s side is not recognized.[1962]

Generally speaking, the feeling that two persons are intimately
connected in some way or other may, through an association of ideas,
give rise to the notion that marriage or intercourse between them is
incestuous. Hence the prohibitions of marriage between relations by
alliance and by adoption. Hence, too, the prohibitions on the ground of
what is called “spiritual relationship.” The Emperor Justinian passed
a law forbidding any man to marry a woman for whom he had stood as
godfather in baptism, the tie of the godfather and godchild being so
analogous to that of the father and child as to make such a marriage
appear improper.[1963] In the Roman Church sponsorship creates a bar to
the marriage even of co-sponsors, and the restriction can be removed
only by a dispensation.[1964] In Eastern Europe, the groomsman at a
wedding comes under a set of rules which forbids intermarriage with the
family of the bride to exactly the same extent as if he were naturally
the brother of the bridegroom.[1965] A similar _cognatio spiritualis_,
according to the old law-books of India, occurs between a pupil and his
“guru,” that is, the teacher who instructs him in the Veda. The pupil
lived in his guru’s house for several years, and regarded him almost
as a father.[1966] Hence adultery with a guru’s wife was considered a
mortal sin.[1967]

But how, then, are we to explain the exceptions, apparent or real,
to the rule that close living together inspires an aversion to
intermarriage? How are we to explain the fact that, besides tribes that
are exogamous, there are others that are endogamous, and that, besides
peoples with very extensive laws against intermarriage, there are
others among whom unions take place between very near relations, such
as brothers and sisters, and even parents and children.

In the next chapter we shall examine the psychological principle which
underlies the endogamous marriage. For the present it is sufficient to
say that endogamy never, except in cases of extreme isolation, seems
to occur among peoples living in very small communities with close
connections between their members. Concerning the Australians, Mr.
Curr expressly states that those tribes which are endogamous are, as
a rule, stronger in numbers than those in which exogamous marriage
obtains.[1968]

The marriage of brother and sister means, as we have seen, in most
cases, marriage between a half-brother and a half-sister, having the
same father but different mothers. Such marriages are not necessarily
contrary to the principle here laid down. Polygyny breaks up the one
family into as many sub-families as there are wives who have children,
and it is not possible for the father of these sub-families to be a
member of each of them in the same sense as the father is a member of
the monogamous family. Nor are the children of the different mothers
brought into such close contact as the children of one mother, every
wife with her own family forming a little separate group, and generally
living in a separate hut.[1969] On the contrary, hatred and rivalry are
of no rare occurrence among the members of the various sub-families.
In the Pelew Islands, according to Herr Kubary, it very seldom happens
that the several wives of the same man even see each other.[1970] After
speaking of the marriage of half-brother and half-sister allowed among
the ancient Arabs, Professor Robertson Smith remarks, “Whatever is the
origin of bars to marriage, they certainly are early associated with
the feeling that it is indecent for housemates to intermarry.”[1971]

Most of the recorded instances of intermarriage of brother and sister
refer to royal families, to the exclusion of others; and there is no
difficulty in accounting for incestuous unions of this sort. Among
lower races, as well as in Europe, it is considered improper for royal
persons to contract marriage with persons of less exalted birth.
But whilst European princes may go to some friendly Court for their
consorts, a similar course is not open to African or Asiatic potentates.

Incestuous unions may also take place on account of necessity, as
among the Wa-taïta, or on account of extreme isolation, as among
the Karens of the Tenasserim Provinces,[1972] several of the small
tribes of Brazil, and especially the Veddahs of Ceylon. Among the wild
Veddahs, the different families are separated from each other by great
distances, and it is only accidentally or occasionally that any others
besides the members of one family are brought together.[1973] The
reason for the practice of marrying a sister, says Professor Virchow,
“was probably the same everywhere, in the royal families as with the
naked Veddahs, the lack of suitable women or of women altogether.”[1974]

Certain instances of incestuous connection are evidently the results of
vitiated instincts, the origin of which we are not able to trace. It
is a remarkable fact that several of the peoples among whom incestuous
intercourse is said to be practised are, at the same time, expressly
stated to indulge in bestiality or other unnatural vices.[1975] This
shows that their sexual feelings are altogether in a perverted state.

Much stress has been laid by anthropologists on the few instances
of peoples who habitually or occasionally contract unions which we
should consider criminal. They have been taken for surviving types
of the primitive condition of man, proving that “sentiments such as
those which among ourselves restrain the sexual instincts are not
innate.”[1976] But it is obvious that they prove nothing of the
kind. Students of early history have often paid too much regard to
exceptions, and too little to rules, overlooking the fact that there is
no rule which has no exceptions.

It may be objected that no feeling of incest exists among the lower
animals.[1977] According to Mr. Huth, incest “is constantly practised
by animals, and habitually by those which are polygamous.”[1978] But,
as we have previously seen, among species that live in families, the
young, without exception, leave the family as soon as they are able
to shift for themselves; and Mr. Huth has adduced not the slightest
evidence for his statement that “polygamy among animals means the
closest incest.”[1979]

The hypothesis here advocated can, I think, account for all the facts
given in the last chapter. It explains how the horror of incest may be
independent of experience as well as of education; why the horror of
incest refers not only to relations by blood, but very frequently to
persons not at all so related; why the prohibitions of consanguineous
marriages vary so considerably with regard to the prohibited degrees,
applying, however, almost universally to persons who live in the
closest contact with each other; and why these prohibitions are so
commonly extended much farther on the one side, the paternal or the
maternal, than on the other. The question now arises:—How has this
instinctive aversion to marriage between persons living closely
together originated?

       *       *       *       *       *

We have seen that a certain degree of similarity as regards the
reproductive system of two individuals is required to make their union
fertile and the progeny resulting from this union fully capable of
propagation. It might, then, be supposed that the highest degree of
similarity must be the most beneficial; but in all probability this
is not the case. It seems to be necessary not only that the sexual
elements which unite shall be somewhat like, but that they shall be in
some way different. The similarity must not be _too_ great.

Mr. Darwin, by his careful studies on the effects of cross- and
self-fertilization in the vegetable kingdom, contributed more largely
than any one else to the discovery of this law. He watched, from
germination to maturity, more than a thousand individual plants,
produced by crossing and self-fertilization, belonging to fifty-seven
species, fifty-two genera, and thirty large families, and including
natives of the most various countries.[1980] The result established by
this research was, that cross-fertilization is generally beneficial,
and self-fertilization injurious; which is shown by the difference in
height, weight, constitutional vigour, and fertility of the offspring
from crossed and self-fertilized flowers, and in the number of seeds
produced by the parent-plants.[1981] Hence, whenever plants which are
the offspring of self-fertilization are opposed in the struggle for
existence to the offspring of cross-fertilization, the latter have the
advantage. And this follows, according to Mr. Darwin, from individuals
of two distinct kinds having been subjected during previous generations
to different conditions, or to their having varied from some unknown
cause in a manner commonly called spontaneous, because of that innate
tendency to vary and to advance in organization which exists in all
beings; so that in either case their sexual elements have been in some
degree differentiated.[1982]

As for the animal kingdom, Mr. Darwin remarks that almost all who
have bred many kinds of animals, and have written on the subject,
have expressed the strongest conviction on the evil effects of close
interbreeding.[1983] “Indeed,” says Sir J. Sebright, “I have no
doubt but that, by this practice being continued, animals would, in
course of time, degenerate to such a degree as to become incapable of
breeding at all.... I have tried many experiments by breeding in-and-in
upon dogs, fowls, and pigeons; the dogs became, from strong spaniels,
weak and diminutive lap-dogs, the fowls became long in the legs, small
in the body, and bad breeders.”[1984] Mr. Huth, on the other hand,
denies that breeding in-and-in, however close, has proved to be in
itself hurtful, and quotes the evidence of numerous breeders whose
choicest stocks have always been so bred. But in these cases, as Mr.
Wallace remarks, “there has been rigid selection by which the weak or
the infertile have been eliminated, and with such selection there is
no doubt that the ill effects of close interbreeding can be prevented
for a long time; but this by no means proves that no ill effects
are produced.”[1985] The consensus of opinion on this point among
eminent breeders is indeed overwhelming, and cannot be reasoned away.
According to Crampe’s experiment with the brown rat (_Mus decumanus_),
thirty-nine animals out of 153 born by related parents, _i.e._, 25·5
per cent., died soon after birth, whereas of 299 animals of parents
not related this was the case with twenty-eight only, _i.e._, 8·4 per
cent. The animals of incestuous broods were much smaller and lighter
than others, and their fecundity was diminished.[1986] Mr. Huth himself
observed, when breeding rabbits in-and-in, that “after the fourth
generation there was a diminution of fecundity analogous to the disgust
that the stomach would feel at the same diet long continued,” though he
found no evil effect in any other way. On the contrary, the in-and-in
bred offspring were somewhat heavier than the non-related parent
animals.[1987] Professor Preyer has made a similar observation with
regard to guinea-pigs: breeding in-and-in produced a considerable loss
of fertility, but was accompanied with an increase of weight.[1988]
This seems to indicate that the effects of close interbreeding are not
always the same.

There are certainly breeders who prefer connecting together the animals
nearest allied in blood to one another. But, as Dr. Mitchell observes,
“when breeding in-and-in has been practised with so-called good
results, the issue is nothing but the development of a saleable defect,
which, from the animal’s point of view, must be regarded as wholly
unnatural and artificial, and not calculated to promote its well-being
or natural usefulness.”[1989]

Many writers suppose that all the evils from close interbreeding depend
upon the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies
common to both parents, the state of whose health decides whether union
would be favourable or not to the offspring. “If the parents are
perfectly healthy,” says M. Pouchet, “and exempt from all commencing
degeneracy, they can only give birth to children _at least_ as healthy
as themselves.... But if the same degeneracy has already tainted both
the parents, the offspring will show it in a greater degree, and will
tend towards entire disappearance.”[1990] The same opinion is held by
Sir John Sebright. But being, as an experienced breeder, well aware of
the injurious results which almost always follow from interbreeding
animals too closely, he adds that, according to his belief, there never
did exist an animal without some defect, in constitution, in form, or
in some other essential quality, or that at least a tendency to the
same imperfection generally prevails in the same family.[1991]

Mr. Darwin, however, has shown it to be highly probable that, though
the injury has often partly resulted from the combination of morbid
tendencies, the general cause is different. Considering the number of
self-fertilized plants that were tried, he thinks it is nothing less
than absurd to suppose that in all these cases the mother-plants,
though not appearing in any way diseased, were weak or unhealthy in so
peculiar a manner that their self-fertilized seedlings, many hundreds
in number, were rendered inferior in height, weight, constitutional
vigour, and fertility to their crossed offspring.[1992] Moreover,
self-fertilization and close interbreeding induce sterility, and this
indicates something quite different from the augmentation of morbid
tendencies common to both parents.[1993] Hence it seems to be almost
beyond doubt that, just as the sterility of distinct species when
first crossed, and of their hybrid offspring, depends on their sexual
elements having been differentiated in too great a degree, the evils of
close interbreeding, or self-fertilization in plants, result chiefly
from their sexual elements not having been sufficiently differentiated.
But we do not know why a certain amount of differentiation is necessary
or favourable for the fertilization or union of two organisms, any more
than for the chemical affinity or union of two substances.[1994] It
must, however, be observed that no case of complete sterility is met
with in self-fertilized seedlings, as is so common with hybrids,[1995]
and that interbreeding even of the nearest relations may sometimes,
under very favourable circumstances, be continued through several
generations without any evil results making their appearance.

It is impossible to believe that a law which holds good for the rest of
the animal kingdom, as well as for plants, does not apply to man also.
But it is d
